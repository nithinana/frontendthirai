"'Would anyone give their life

00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,541
"It is the breath of a race."

4
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,125
"It is an identity."

"England obliterated the Gaelic language

an oppressor's language..."

12
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,541
"...the Indian leaders up north
decided everyone must speak Hindi."

"The Puranaanooru Squad."

22
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,791
He was part of the very first batch
trained in espionage by Russia's KGB, sir.

23
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,250
One of the finest and sharpest officers
we have.

24
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,500
Officer Thiru.
Thirunadan.

25
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,000
KGB, huh?

26
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,166
You must be brilliant.

27
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,916
I am what I am.

28
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,500
Who is that arrogant prick?

00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,416
At your service, sir.

32
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,791
Just got on at the last station.

33
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Sir?

34
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,125
Don't, Chezhiya!
Fall back!

35
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,750
Should we die for a language?

36
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,000
Then what? Should we keep bowing to them
for life?

37
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,916
We must strike back!
We must create history!

38
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,250
We're fighting for your language too,
Govind!

39
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,291
Join us if you want!
If you're scared, run away!

40
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,000
You'll die!
Please listen to me!

41
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,291
Back away!

-Yes, sir?

47
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,500

are protected!

'Bear witness, for ours is a great army'

52
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,000
There are too many of them.

53
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,875
Never mind the protestors.

54
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,875
Protect the ministers.

55
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,250
Okay, sir.
Come on!

Come on!
-'Ours is a great army'

60
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,375
Hurry!

61
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,666
Make it fast!

62
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,625
(Let justice prevail)

63
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,875
Get everyone out, Major!

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,791
Nobody must remain in the compartment!
This is Major's order!

65
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,166
(Telugu) "Major"?
He didn't clear the last selection!

66
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,875
(Telugu) Just a "Minor!"
-You'll salute this Major one day!

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,291
Nobody panic!
Leave calmly!

68
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,500
(Malayalam) Go quickly!

69
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,375
(Bengali) Careful!

70
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:53,791
Get going!

71
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,750
Come along, I say!

72
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,250
Come on!
-(Hindi) Let go of my hand!

73
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,250
Hold on!
-(Hindi) Don't be scared!

74
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,500
You needn't be afraid!

75
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,250
You needn't be afraid, ma'am!
We're...

76
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,041
We're only fighting the imposition
of Hindi!

77
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,000
We're not against Hindi or its speakers!

78
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,541
Please don't cry.
Don't be afraid.

79
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,666
Tell me what I need to do.

80
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
Get them out of here safely, Govind.

81
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,541
'Fire up your intellect
and make your foes tremble'

82
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,750
Go to Madurai and lay low at home,
Govind.

83
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,291
I'll send word! Come later!
-Okay!

84
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,000
Ensure he leaves safe!
I'll check if there's anyone left behind!

85
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,291
Sir!

86
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,500
'Bring your hands together
and bolster the army'

87
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,250

'Bear witness, for ours is a great army'

91
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,750
Govind's left, hasn't he?
-He left with Aavudai!

92
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,000
Hurry!
No one should get caught by the police!

93
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,625
Long Live the Prime Minister!

94
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,416
I proudly welcome the citizens of Madurai
who are here today...

95
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,541
...for the inauguration of
the Gandhi Memorial!

96
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,750
Our beloved Prime Minister
has arrived!

97
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,000
Welcome, sir.
Make way!

98
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,750
(Hindi) Who did this?

99
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,375
Hooligans from the opposition.
We'll get them.

100
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,125
No one to beat them, sir!
Top class work!

101
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,625
The fire was made by people
who know chemistry. It spreads fast!

102
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,875
They've planned their next moves
thoroughly.

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,916
They stopped the train between two stations
so they'd have an easy escape.

104
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,250
They wrapped it up in just six minutes
and took off.

105
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,250
Tamil fanatics, huh?

106
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,500
Not exactly.

107
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,666
Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali
and Marathi speaking students!

108
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,875
About twenty in all!

109
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,625
I think it's a student movement, sir.

110
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,625
Spread across the country.

111
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,625
Mr. Prime Minister,
this act seems to be for political gain.

112
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,750
Wait outside, Thiru.

113
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
Thiru?

114
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,250
Sir...

115
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,125
There were railway job openings
listed in Hindi newspapers.

116
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,625
But not in the Tamil ones.

117
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,166
This is what provoked the students.

118
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,541
So, they burned the train.

119
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,000
This is purely reactionary.

120
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,041
But, sir...

121
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,500
We must hunt them down!

122
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,291
They should be eradicated.

123
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No.

124
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,500
This issue can't be solved
with violence.

125
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,250
It shouldn't give rise
to more dissenters.

126
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,875
I want this incident to be depicted
as nothing but a fire accident.

127
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Understood?

128
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,291
Thiru!

129
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,166
(Sanskrit) "Alertness Every Moment".

130
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,666
Always alert.

131
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,000
That's the IB's motto, right?

132
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,666
Did someone steal your revolver,
or did you give it away to your comrades?

133
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,875
(Hindi) Hold up!

134
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,750
How can you fire it...

135
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,250
...when the Tamil blood of your father
runs in your veins?

136
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,250
You're not just any misbegot.

137
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,875
You are a Madrasi misbegot.

138
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,541
You have an accurate summary
of my blood report.

139
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,625
Had you been as thorough
with the ground report...

140
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,250
...we could've avoided all this,
Chief of Intelligence.

141
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,916
You're the one who gave the false report,
wasn't it?

142
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,375
This isn't over!

143
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,666
You'll face an enquiry for this!
You will pay for this!

144
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,541
"It has come to my attention..."

145
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,166
...that my brethren
from the Southern states...

146
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,500
"...are troubled
by the Official Languages Act."

147
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,875
"Should they be forced
to only speak in Hindi..."

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,666
"...in official correspondence
with the government..."

149
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,791
...I understand the fear of those
in non-Hindi speaking regions...

150
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,875
"...of being denied access
to welfare schemes..."

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
...and opportunities
they rightfully deserve.

152
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,666
"I truly comprehend and sympathize
with your emotions."

153
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,000
"Until all non-Hindi speaking states..."

154
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,166
"...give their unanimous consent to accept
Hindi as the official language..."

155
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:45,166
"...I pledge that English shall continue
to be an official language until 1965."

156
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,291
"And will remain so..."

157
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,625
...even beyond that.
You have my word.

158
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,375
Tamilarasan!
-Present, sir!

159
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,291
'She, who is as sweet as Tamil...'
-Muthiah!

160
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,416
You heard the song!
A fight fete is about to start!

161
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,375
'She, who is like a flowering vine...'

162
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,541
'She, who is like a flowering vine
that smiles like the moon'

163
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,875
'With her honey lips,
she will endow the essence of life'

164
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,250
'As you savor it drop by drop,
she will bend her head shyly'

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,416
'She, who is as sweet as Tamil...'

166
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,625
'She, who is like a flowering vine
that smiles like the moon'

167
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,666
'She, who is like a flowering vine
that smiles like the moon'

168
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,416
Freedom!
Isn't that what we want?

169
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,541
Yes!

170
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,625
One can have love for a language!

171
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,000
But what you are possessed by
is language fanaticism!

172
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,666
We see Tamil only as a language, sir!

173
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,541
They're the ones turning it
to fanaticism.

174
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,625
Think we'll let trains enter our town when
railway jobs aren't listed in Tamil papers?

175
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,875
When none of us can get those jobs,
how can we permit it?

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
How can we?

177
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,125
We won't!

178
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,041
Never mind!
Such ads used to come in English!

179
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,875
We only asked why they were discontinued!

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,375
English is an alien language.

181
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,666
To us, everything but Tamil
is an alien language!

182
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,625
Isn't Hindi an alien language
in many states?

183
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,375
With English, you can talk to anyone
in the world, Mr. Principal!

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,625
Why are you getting mixed up
with these kids, Mr. Tamil Professor?

185
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,291
Wouldn't it be helpful to the government,
if we all speak the same language?

186
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,916
For national unity, right?

187
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,166
Mr. Principal!

188
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,916
We were united
when we sent the British packing!

189
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,875
Were we all speaking the same language
then?

190
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No!

191
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,541
Answer Chezhiyan, sir!

192
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,000
No matter how he protests,
he's still the college topper!

193
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,166
These guys are Delhi politicians!

194
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,666
That's their vow for now.
Don't trust them.

195
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,625
If they break their vow,
their domain will be torched next!

196
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,875
The vow of the students!

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We always walk the talk!

198
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,666
Yes, we will!
-Good grief...

199
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,125
Yes, we will!

200
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,750
Can I carry that for you, sir?

201
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,625
Move aside!

202
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,875
Mr. Principal doesn't need English,
but only needs English cars!

203
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,791
'The time is ours...'

204
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,666
'With the speed of fire'

205
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,250
'Unhating courage...
Worthy sacrifice...'

206
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,750
'Let's stand for our language'

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,875
'Strap on those wings and step up'

208
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,666
'Hit that beat and sing your heart away'

209
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,000
'Directions eight will join hands,
because of you'

210
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,750
'Our blood is on fire'

211
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,791
'The crowds roar
when your name is heard'

212
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,916
'Our nation shall triumph,
because of us'

213
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,166
(Long Live Tamil)

214
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
'Every town is our own'

215
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,291
'Tomorrow is ours for the taking'

216
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,875
'When hands join together as one...'

217
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,125
'...anything is possible now on'

218
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,166
'If we all just tend to our homes,
who will tend to our nation?'

219
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,375
'Charge in with all your might'

220
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,375
'No town an alien land...
No person a stranger...'

221
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,250
'Come on, comrade...
Let's begin'

222
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,250
'Celebrate like never before,
for that is our culture'

223
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,375
'Should anyone come to divide us,
step up and question them'

224
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,125
'Keep moving forward...
As our ancestors taught us'

225
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,666
'Their good words guide us onward'

226
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,875
'The time is ours...'

227
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,875
'With the speed of fire'

228
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,125
'Unhating courage...
Worthy sacrifice...'

229
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,750
'Let's stand for our language'

230
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,666
'Strap on those wings and step up'

231
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,625
'Hit that beat and sing your heart away'

232
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,000
'Directions eight will join hands,

233
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,500

'The crowds roar
when your name is heard'

235
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,625
'Our nation shall triumph,
because of us'

236
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,041
You relay messages
on money orders, Chezhiya.

237
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,416
After which members of your
Puranaanooru Squad come over...

238
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,500
...to burn down trains
and conduct protests.

239
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,250
You guys are a force to be reckoned with!

240
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,750
But you're all done, right?

241
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,875
Why send another money order?

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,541
What if we need it for the next protest?

243
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,666
Be careful, son.

244
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,541
The police are on the prowl.

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,625
If caught, they'll trump up the charges
and bury you sixty feet down!

246
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,250
Like we'll let it happen!

247
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,750
The Young Lawyers Association will fight
for justice of students for no fee!

248
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,916
That's my lawyer for you!

249
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,375
How's our legal counsel, sir?

250
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,125
Is that why you studied 'Brahmi'
with me?

251
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,250
Hey Aavudai!

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,166
Where's Govind?

253
00:17:58,875 --> 00:17:59,875
Chezhiya...

254
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,375
"The train transporting central ministers
to Madurai met with a fire accident."

255
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,000
"A student passenger burned to death."

256
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,625
With your name constantly on his lips...

257
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,125
...he'd always be right by your side!

258
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,875
And yet, you stand here without him!

259
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,625
What are you saying, mom?

260
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,375
You think Chezhiya would've let this happen
to Govind?

261
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,750
Chezhiya is one of us, mom!

262
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,000
(Saurashtra) He's family!

263
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,291
Come in, Chezhiya!

264
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,125
No, Chezhiya! We'll slip and fall!
-Hurry!

265
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,750
I'll bring him back safely every vacation,
auntie!

266
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,166
(Saurashtra) Travel safe, dear!

267
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,791
Come!
-(Saurashtra) Bye, grandma!

268
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,541
(Saurashtra) Take care!
-Be safe, dear!

269
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,375
You'd never have come if I hadn't called!

270
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,791
Hello?

271
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,250
Brother Thambi?

272
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,666
Chezhiya?

273
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,041
Michael Reddy, Shariffa,
Chacko and Bindhya...

274
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,125
They're safe at Thambiraja's mill
in Pollachi.

275
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,500
They asked if they have to come.

276
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,916
What do I tell them?

277
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,250
(Hindi) Clench your fists.

278
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,000
Your pulses are very weak.

279
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,875
Your nerves have been damaged.
You will need an amputation.

280
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,375
No!

281
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Stitch it up!

282
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,875
What are you doing, Thiru?

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's your problem?

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,541
You slept with a Tamilian
and gave birth to me!

285
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,125
Once he was satisfied, he abandoned you!

286
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,375
Thanks to another Tamilian,
I lost an arm!

287
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,125
How will I fire now?

288
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,750
It's our Puranaanooru Squad.

289
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,875
Shall I ask them to come, Chezhiya?

290
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,041
No one needs to come anymore.

291
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,375
I'm not ready to lose anyone else.

292
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,166
As of now,
I'm nothing but a Tamil-speaking cripple!

293
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,916
A Madrasi traitor!

294
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,375
If that's what you believe...

295
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,750
...the world will continue to belittle you
and mock at you!

296
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,625
The Puranaanooru Squad is no more!

297
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,875
Understood?
-Chezhiya!

298
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,291
No more money orders, protests...
No nothing!

299
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,250
The Puranaanooru Squad is dead!

300
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,875
Mom?

301
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,625
I accept who I am.

302
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,125
I don't want anyone else to die
because of me!

303
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,666
I don't want anyone else to die
because of me...

304
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,916
"The Supreme Power."

305
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,000
Brother!
Turn off that valve!

306
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,000
If the pressure rises, it'll explode!

307
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,375
(Hindi) What? Everything's fine!
What are you saying?

308
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,500
(Broken Hindi) "What happened?"

309
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,000
Had it blown up,
you'd be in pieces!

310
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,541
You'd have killed 250 people too!

311
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,916
"Engine blowback"!
Didn't they teach you that?

312
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,666
You'd have been toasted!
-(Hindi) What?

313
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,250
(Hindi) Speak in Hindi, Madrasi!

314
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,416
(Hindi) From January 26th,
you'll have no choice!

315
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,875
(Broken Tamil) You must speak it then!
For now, just do your job, fireman!

316
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
(Hindi) Got it?

317
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,125
Nothing's going to change!

318
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,375
Just watch!

319
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,875
The PM maybe no more, but his vow
to the Parliament still is!

320
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
(Hindi) What?

321
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,541
Back to Hindi, eh?

322
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,750
(Broken Hindi) Lal! When a Madrasi
goes to Delhi, he'll talk in Hindi!

323
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,000
(Broken Hindi) When a Hindi guy
comes to Madurai, he must talk in Tamil!

324
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,250
(Broken Hindi) Got it?

325
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,875
(Hindi) Madurai... Madrasi...
What?

326
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,041
Chow down!

327
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,166
(Hindi) This fritter is delicious!

328
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,291
How's that?

329
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,500
You don't want Tamil,
but you want our fritters, eh?

330
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,166
Your whack is waiting!

331
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,375
(Hindi) Come again, Madrasi?

332
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,750
Two one pennies!

333
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:48,875
Goddamn it!

334
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,875
Don't say it like that, you dumbos!
-How else then?

335
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,541
"One penny plus one penny
equal two pennies."

336
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,416
One penny plus one penny
equal two pennies!

337
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,750
Don't shout, sillies!

338
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,916
"Due to the death
of the Indian Prime Minister..."

339
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:03,250
"...the last twelve days were declared
to be a period of mourning nationwide."

340
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,625
"It comes to an end today."

341
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,500
What a good man!

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,666
Without warning, he left us all!

343
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,750
You thought he'd die
after a heart-to-heart with you?

344
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,250
The Telugu girl from next door
has arrived!

345
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,000
Her eyes and ears
are always here!

346
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,500
(Telugu) 'The womenfolk have risen'

347
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,000
What are you staring at there?
-(Telugu) 'The womenfolk have risen'

348
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,875
Good grief!
She's at it again!

349
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,875
Kid!

350
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,291
Chezhiyan will be here soon!

351
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,541
Why try to fix it yourself?

352
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,625
You don't need him for this!

353
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,875
(Telugu) I got it!

354
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,541
Careful, Ratna!

355
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,291
Easy does it!
-Just take this wire...

356
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,750
...and stick it in like this.

357
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,625
All done!

358
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,375
All done, indeed!

359
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,541
Why's the power out, grandma?

360
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,500
Only one bulb was flickering.

361
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,625
She just had to mess with it!

362
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,500
The entire house went dark!
-She's had it!

363
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,125
She truly has the magic touch!

364
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,250
Didn't I tell you not to let her in here,
grandma?

365
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:06,875
Like I let her in!

366
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,375
Want to pull wires?
Do it at your house!

367
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,250
I will if you get out of my way,
tosser!

368
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,666
Who are you calling 'tosser'?

369
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,291
You toss coal, right?

370
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,416
Coal tosser!

371
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,791
Why do I even talk to this creature?

372
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Dinner ready, grandma?

373
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,250
It's been ready for a while!
The same tamarind stew!

374
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,250
It's back!

375
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,375
There's a letter for you, Chezhiya!

376
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
A letter?

377
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:30,625
Where is it?

378
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,291
Here!
-Let me see!

379
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,500
Who is it from?

380
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,125
Your grandson's going to become
a ticket examiner!

381
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,666
He's being called for an interview!

382
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,500
Posting's in Delhi!
-Really?

383
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:59,250
If anyone calls me a coal tosser again,
tell them I'll rip their tongue out!

384
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,875
You just have to learn Hindi!

385
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,750
Hindi, huh?

386
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,375
That's a hopeless cause
for our entire clan!

387
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,250
I sent you to three teachers
when you were a kid.

388
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,000
You couldn't even get three words right!

389
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,750
I couldn't because I didn't need it then!

390
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,375
Wherever you go to work,
you must learn the local language!

391
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,416
Then how am I any different
from that Hindi speaking loco pilot?

392
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,500
Don't you know Hindi well, Telugu girl?

393
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,791
Why don't you teach him?

394
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,166
Who? Her?

395
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,500
I'd rather shovel coal for life
than learn Hindi from her!

396
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,250
There's the Hindi Federation, right?

397
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,250
I'm your only option
in this entire locality!

398
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,166
But I can't teach you!

399
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,416
Pay for a course and learn!

400
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,750
It's late. I have an important
news recording in the morning.

401
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,000
Trains will run without him.

402
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,291
Even the government will run
without my father!

403
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:49,750
But without Ratnamala,
the National Radio will be at a standstill!

404
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,125
Understand that!
Move, tosser!

405
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,250
Ratna!

406
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,000
I've never once heard your voice
on the radio!

407
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,750
What station should I connect to?
-What, indeed?

408
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,666
First, disconnect that deaf ear of yours!

409
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,125
The mouth on this girl!

410
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,625
What did she say?

411
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,916
Come feed me dinner!

412
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,125
They've closed down colleges.

413
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,375
Durai's not home yet?

414
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,166
Like he ever tells me when he comes
and goes!

415
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,250
He roams around town like a jackass!

416
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,750
You slog in that oven all day for him
and come here dark as the night!

417
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
After raking coal all day,
you expect me to shine like the moon?

418
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,750
He's at the top of his class.

419
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:27,916
Don't scold him.

420
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,375
I can understand sending it
to Govind's family.

421
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,375
But why send money to your brother
when he's not even asking for it?

422
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,541
You took loans all over town
to make him study!

423
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,500
Does he ever think about that?

424
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,875
Will you serve dinner or not?

425
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,375
He needn't think about anything!

426
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,166
It's good enough if he becomes an engineer
and works a cushy job!

427
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,500
As long as he does that, good.

428
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,625
Serve dinner!

429
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:52,875
National Radio!

430
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,375
Greetings!
-Greetings, dear!

431
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
(Telugu) 'The man's world quakes'

432
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,750
(Telugu) 'The womenfolk have risen'

433
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:03,875
Please move, ma'am.

434
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,625
(Telugu) 'The womenfolk...'

435
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,375
(Telugu) 'The womenfolk have risen'

436
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Your tea, sir.

437
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Greetings, ma'am.

438
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,791
Good Morning, ma'am!

439
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,250
Greetings, ma'am!

440
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,625
Good Morning, ma'am!

441
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:18,875
(Telugu) 'The man's world quakes'

442
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:22,041
(Telugu) 'The womenfolk have risen'

443
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,791
(Telugu) 'The man's world quakes'

444
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,125
Who told you to clean the windows,
miss?

445
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,125
Your father will sack me if he learns
you're not doing the announcer job!

446
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,875
Just once come to the studio!
Read this!

447
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,500
Me?
-Yes! Look!

448
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,250
Just seeing a mic paralyzes me!

449
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,541
You can do it!
-I'll stammer!

450
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,625
Just read this once!
-You already know that!

451
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,000
You can do it! Just try!
-Sir!

452
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,875
Goo... Good Morning.
Here's the morning news.

453
00:27:58,875 --> 00:27:59,916
Excellent!

454
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:05,500
The central government's
key obj... objective..

455
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,000
...is progress through peace.

456
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,625
Lovely!

457
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,875
A new...

458
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,750
...sch... scheme...

459
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,125
She thinks she can go on the air
with that stutter!

460
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,375
...has been implem... implemented...

461
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,666
Miss?
-...and...

462
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,416
She has come here using influence
and is torturing us. So useless!

463
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,750
Didn't I tell you, sir?
-Tell me what?

464
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,041
Rest assured,
I won't tell my father about this!

465
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,625
Hold on!

466
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,541
Fill mine in first, sister. I'll have to
send money to my grandson at college.

467
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,000
Such a stubborn one!

468
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,500
He'd rather starve to death
than ask for money!

469
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,625
Fill mine!
-Wait!

470
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,250
My son's hands are sore
from working at the tannery!

471
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,000
I need to send money
so he can buy medicine.

472
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,500
Look what these morons have done!

473
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,041
What is this?

474
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,250
Move.
-Ask them yourself!

475
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,500
What language is this?

476
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,791
You've given the wrong form.
I need the Tamil one!

477
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,291
This is how it is now, ma'am.
By order of the central government.

478
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,000
What language is this?

479
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,125
It's Hindi, ma'am.

480
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,541
The central government has made
these forms mandatory.

481
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,375
I'm the one sending money.
My grandson's the one receiving it.

482
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,125
Neither of us know this language,
dear fellow!

483
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,000
Fill it out yourself!

484
00:29:56,125 --> 00:30:00,500
Wouldn't we have become ministers in Delhi
if we knew Hindi, ma'am?

485
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,875
You useless nincompoops!

486
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,666
So we'll have to personally go to Delhi
to send money orders?

487
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:08,916
Come along!

488
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,500
Nothing to discuss here! Let's go!

489
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,375
Come along! Hurry!
-Way to give us trouble!

490
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,166
What will my grandson do for sustenance?
-Go tend to your errands!

491
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,000
We got him on the line!
Come, Muthammal!

492
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,416
PP holding trunk call
from Annamalai University.

493
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,750
"Annamalai?"

494
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:26,250
(Telugu) Is this an MP's residence
or a post office, mom?

495
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,666
He and Ratna are childhood friends,
right?

496
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,875
Go answer it, Muthammal.

497
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,291
Hello?
-What is it, grandma?

498
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,000
Little one?
-I hear you! Go on!

499
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,250
We can't send money this month to you.
-What happened?

500
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,916
At the post office,
every damn thing is in Hindi!

501
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,041
"Hindi?"

502
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:51,541
In just one day, these chumps rendered me,
an eighth grade graduate, illiterate!

503
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:56,125
I'll have your brother send money to you
by train.

504
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,625
What about the other students?

505
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,041
Shammi Kapoor is in a league of his own!

506
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,375
Who the hell stopped the screening?

507
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:27,250
The kid from the engineering department
changed the reel!

508
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,541
Thinks he's a big shot!

509
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,791
Will you play a Hindi film
or do I smash your head?

510
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:31,916
Hey, monkey!

511
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,500
Hindi films for three weeks in a row?

512
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,375
Sit quietly in a corner
and watch our film!

513
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,041
Crackling dialogues right here!

514
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:38,541
Thrash him!

515
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,750
Careful, Durai!

516
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,916
Why are you beating up kids?

517
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,500
We've got bigger fish to fry!
Come!

518
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,666
Come along!

519
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:05,250
The central minister has decreed the
Hindi Federation as a national institution!

520
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,625
It'll be announced on the radio
at 7 AM tomorrow!

521
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,625
Got it, Chinnadurai?
-Hold on!

522
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,625
This is the first step they're taking
to make Hindi our sole official language!

523
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,291
Then, we students
have to land the first blow!

524
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:22,125
You brought quite a scoop
in your first week on the job, Ratna!

525
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:23,750
We'll torch it!

526
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,625
'In street after street...'
-Get the stuff! Get all the petrol cans!

527
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,625
Don't forget the bottles!
-I have them, buddy!

528
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,041
Buddy!
-Come on!

529
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,791
We'll crank it up...
-Come on!

530
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,250
...and stomp it out!
-You got it!

531
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,750
'Gums that flap needlessly,
will have no teeth for company'

532
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,916
Why'd you come all this way,
Ratna?

533
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,666
One trunk call and we'd have come over!

534
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,000
Good thing I showed up!

535
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,916
If I hadn't, that politician’s son
would've rearranged your face!

536
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,250
'I'll be by your side, for sure'

537
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,916
'You may dispatch an army after us,
we'll soldier on with all smiles'

538
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,541
Quick! Muthammal will scold us!
-We're coming!

539
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,000
We're heading to tuition class, Chezhiya!
-Right!

540
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,125
See you!
Study well!

541
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,750
Mr. Teacher!

542
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,375
You said you'd teach me Hindi.
Where are you off to?

543
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,125
The Himalayas!
Want to join me?

544
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,250
Forget Hindi!
You keep driving!

545
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,750
Haven't even started teaching,
and you ask me to forget it?

546
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,000
Not a man of your word, eh?

547
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,416
What about the two rupees I gave?

548
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,875
Reclaim it from the Hindi Federation
if you can!

549
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,875
Take it and put it on your forehead!

550
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,375
Keep driving!
Go!

551
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,125
Stand back!

552
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,541
Back off, I say!

553
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,625
(Let justice prevail)

554
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,250
Hello, sir.

555
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,166
Welcome back, sir.

556
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,041
Ensure the reports are sent to the CM.

557
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,000
The brilliant KGB trainee!

558
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,625
You couldn't stop them from burning down
the train, nor could you catch them!

559
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,291
And yet, they assigned you to this?

560
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,291
Arsonism.

561
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,500
The same method of operation
as the train incident of 1959.

562
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,125
Could it be the same perpetrator?

563
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,041
She is the intelligence assistant.

564
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,166
Gauri.
-Sir.

565
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,125
Deputed from the postal service?

566
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,791
Yes, sir.

567
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,750
What's my role at the Intelligence Bureau?

568
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,916
It's to not ask such questions
and do what I say. That's all.

569
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,916
For doing a day of work, your husband earns
a wage of five 'annas'.

570
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,750
Don't get me started!

571
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,625
Since when has he gone to work?

572
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,666
Useless fellow!

573
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,125
What Math geniuses!

574
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,750
School's out!
Get going, oldies!

575
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:46,250
They gave you leave on the day
the PM died. Why didn't you come?

576
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:48,875
I would've come had you died.

577
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,500
The elder grandson's here, right?

578
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:53,500
He earns well by being a slave to the
Hindi imposing central government!

579
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,250
Wash your hands and feet!

580
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,625
Sure, talk all high and mighty!

581
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,375
Your father died in the line of duty,
leaving a mountain of debt!

582
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,416
Your brother left his studies
to go shovel coal!

583
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:06,000
Have you ever seen
his coal-stained hands?

584
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,750
He is our savior, man!

585
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,375
Despite knowing that,
you roam around like a hooligan!

586
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,791
Fine. Our savior's there and so,
we can sustain ourselves.

587
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,125
You're there to cook tasty food.
Don't you need someone to eat?

588
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,166
Come, grandma! Feed me!
I'm hungry!

589
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:23,666
Come on.

590
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,500
We can barely afford
good food.

591
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,125
And you intend to reform
the country, Durai?

592
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,125
Tamarind stew today too?

593
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,291
Even the great Anna eats tamarind stew!
-Brother!

594
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Hello, brother.

595
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,250
Why'd you burn down the building?

596
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,416
Burned it?
Who? Me?

597
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:42,291
Which building?
-Drop the act!

598
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:43,750
My hand!
It hurts!

599
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,125
Let him go!

600
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,416
I've come straight from college!

601
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,291
Definitely her handiwork!
-"Her"?

602
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,416
Who?

603
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:53,916
Kannagi, grandma!

604
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,500
Her anger won't subside unless she burns
something in Madurai once a year!

605
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,041
She definitely did it!

606
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,750
Trying to be funny?

607
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,500
Be it in blood or in water,
I can recognize your handwriting!

608
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,291
(Let justice prevail)

609
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,750
Stop!

610
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,750
I've been soft with you as you're orphans,
but you're always at each other’s throats!

611
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:24,916
Stop!

612
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,875
Don't!

613
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,250
Careful, O elder one!

614
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,875
'In street after street,
we'll strike back in kind'

615
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,750
'If they try beating us down,
we'll finish it, no sweat'

616
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,000
'Gums that flap needlessly,
will no longer have teeth for company'

617
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:44,166
'This khadi-clad army will twist
the system around'

618
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,416
Chinna!

619
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:54,416
You two have nothing better to do
than fighting?

620
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,416
We're trying to work over here!

621
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,625
Get going, you!
This is always a habit with them!

622
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,541
Why'd you burn that building, you rascal?

623
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,375
Get out of here!
There are people around!

624
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,375
They changed everything to Hindi
overnight!

625
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,125
Students didn't get their money orders!

626
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,125
If we don't pay up, they won't feed us
at the mess or let us write exams!

627
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,125
You need to think it through!

628
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,375
The minute they imposed a language...

629
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,625
...notice how we begin struggling
for food?

630
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,250
If we don't question this...

631
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:24,250
...they won't even spare
the downtrodden!

632
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:27,375
There are folks in the legislative assembly
to question that!

633
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,125
Not a brick!

634
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,916
Think acts of arson can fix everything?

635
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,625
The public will never endorse
the use of violence!

636
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,166
Your only job is to study!
Just focus on that!

637
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,916
They won't endorse violence,
but they'll show up to watch it, right?

638
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,416
That's good enough!

639
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:48,625
Tamil will prevail!

640
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,375
Durai!

641
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,166
You wretches! Always a habit with you!
-Stop!

642
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,625
Stop it!
Why are you doing this?

643
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,166
Stop!
-Listen to me, Durai!

644
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,166
At this age, you won't see
my point.

645
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,166
You accomplished your goal, right?

646
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,375
Promise you won't burn or destroy
anything again.

647
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,125
If you're caught, they won't spare you!

648
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,250
Have I ever asked you for anything
before?

649
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:18,875
Alright, brother.

650
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,666
I won't burn anything anymore.

651
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,541
'Even if the town entire
stands opposite...'

652
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:32,416
'...I'll be by your side, for sure'

653
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:36,000
'You may dispatch an army after us,
we'll soldier on with all smiles'

654
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,541
'Even the skies
will shake with thunder'

655
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:40,041
'So high is our aim'

656
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:42,500
What the hell?
You gave your word in a heartbeat!

657
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,875
His beatings scared you?

658
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,291
Like that'd scare me!

659
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,791
For the first time in my life,
my brother hugged me.

660
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,375
My precious!

661
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,791
You softie!

662
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:56,041
That Telugu girl next door
is corrupting you!

663
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Let's go.

664
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,666
What, brother?
-Squat, brother!

665
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,375
Come home once a week, without fail!

666
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,375
For what?
To eat Grandma's tamarind stew?

667
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Buzz off!

668
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,625
Lay off the troublemaking!
Listen to this 'anna' (brother), too!

669
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:15,250
Come on! I swore to you, didn't I?
Then what?

670
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,750
Get on!

671
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,250
Get on, I say!
-Always nitpicking!

672
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,541
Take these inside!

673
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Come here!

674
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Go on!

675
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:35,000
'I shall walk with pride,
knowing my brother is by my side'

676
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:39,291
'Standing upon your shoulders,
I shall snatch the stars'

677
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
'The world's in the palm of your hand...
Spin it with style'

678
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:47,541
'Even when everything rises in opposition,
let your spirit never fade'

679
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,916
Brother...

680
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,375
'We may be poles apart,
but our pride's one'

681
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,375
'Let's see this through,
come what may'

682
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,541
(Hindi) The train's moving! Get in!
-Okay, sir!

683
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,541
The Chief Minister will see you now, sir.

684
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,625
Good Morning.

685
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:32,750
Since the year 1939...

686
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,250
...protests against Hindi imposition
have taken place here.

687
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:41,416
They'll protest for a while
before moving on to other business.

688
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,250
I've seen the same damn schtick
for the last twenty five years!

689
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,750
Now, a bunch of hooligans...

690
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,375
...burned down a building.

691
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:53,916
Is it really that big an issue?

692
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,416
And you came all the way from Delhi
to investigate it?

693
00:41:56,916 --> 00:42:00,916
You're yet to witness
January 26th, 1965, if I'm right.

694
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:02,541
That's why I'm here.

695
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,666
"Special Powers Act."

696
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,125
That means you have the right
to do anything you wish?

697
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,875
You have an all-encompassing authority
granted by the Prime Minister, am I right?

698
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,625
Then what are the cops and ministers
here for?

699
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,250
They have an important job, sir.

700
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,000
To sign every file
we send over.

701
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,541
(Telugu) 'O little lassie...'

702
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,250
"Ratnamala."

703
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,500
"Apprentice"?

704
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,875
"Trains will run without you.
Even the govt. will run without my father."

705
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,375
"Without Ratnamala, the National Radio
will be at a standstill! Understand that!"

706
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:56,875
Yes, I have.

707
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:01,375
"The High and Noble MP's daughter
reaches high to clean windows!"

708
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,000
Great headline, isn't it?

709
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:05,916
How much do you want?

710
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:11,250
Keep it. You'll need it to buy
cleaning fluids and wash cloths!

711
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,250
Teach me Hindi!

712
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,125
The Hindi Federation can do that!

713
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:17,875
You burned it down, right?

714
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,625
How can I teach you?
I can't do it!

715
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,750
Why not?

716
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:28,750
I'm the secretary of the All India
Anti-Hindi Students Council!

717
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,750
Does your daddy know about that,
Ms. Secretary?

718
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,625
(Telugu) 'O little lassie...'

719
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,875
(Telugu) 'The womenfolk'

720
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:48,625
(Telugu) 'The womenfolk have risen'

721
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,166
Hey!

722
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:53,875
(Telugu) What?

723
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,416
5 AM tomorrow!

724
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,625
Not just my father.
Nobody should know about this!

725
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,500
But no fee!
Make note of that as well!

726
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,416
(Telugu) Stingy fellow!

727
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,625
What'd you just say?

728
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:13,125
Make sure you come by 5:10.
Now go!

729
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:21,625
(Hindi) A for apple!

730
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:24,791
(Hindi) B for ball!

731
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,666
(Hindi) A for apple!
-(Hindi) A for apple!

732
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,666
(Hindi) A for...

733
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:32,125
(Hindi) Apple!

734
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:35,791
(Hindi) A for...
-Poovai!

735
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:37,666
Work properly or I'll whack you!
-Got it!

736
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:38,791
Pay attention!

737
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,375
(Hindi) A for...

738
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
(Hindi) A for?
-(Hindi) A for...

739
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,500
(Hindi) Apple! Apple! Apple!
-Brother!

740
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,250
She's saying 'A for Apple'!
-I'll rip your tongue out!

741
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,375
Spare me this crap!
-Wait!

742
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,750
If you learn Hindi, you can sell soda
up north! Business will boom!

743
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,875
I don't care if it booms or bombs!

744
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,625
I own this factory!

745
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,625
If anyone sees me getting whacked by her,
I'll even lose local business!

746
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,750
Leave me be!

747
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,291
She'll teach us for no charge!

748
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,875
No one else does that!
-(Hindi) Sit!

749
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,500
You received awards
from greats like Anna and Periyar!

750
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,250
Should you learn Hindi from this sadist
to make a living?

751
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:14,500
Come on!

752
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,250
Don't you know even Anna learned Hindi,
Vaigarai?

753
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,875
We ought to know what's in it, right?

754
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,166
He probably learned from a good teacher!
Buzz off!

755
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:22,625
A for Apple, eh?
You've had it!

756
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,041
Why are you taking it out on me
if you don't get Hindi?

757
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,166
You run along too!

758
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,500
I won't! I'm here to learn!
Continue!

759
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:32,875
(Broken Hindi) A for Apple!
B for ball!

760
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,625
You may be dumb,
but you have passion.

761
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,541
Good. I like it.

762
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,000
(Broken Hindi) B for ball.

763
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,750
That's... from the engine...

764
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,916
If you come to class
like a pile of dirty laundry...

765
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,500
...how can you learn properly?

766
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Come neat and clean!

767
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,416
Then, we'll continue.

768
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,000
Run along!

769
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,791
That's all? Only two words?
-(Hindi) Go!

770
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:07,125
At this rate, when will I finish
learning Hindi?

771
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,500
How'd we get these donation boxes?

772
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:18,625
To get donations for the Hindi resistance,
I had them placed all over Madras State!

773
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,125
We even sent receipts after learning
where the money was sent from.

774
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,875
Most donations came from Madras,
Madurai, Coimbatore, Trichy and Cuddalore!

775
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,416
Not just students.
Even citizens donated wholeheartedly!

776
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,875
Pollachi went a step further.

777
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,041
Even cops donated!

778
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,125
Kid!
Mr. New Officer!

779
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,041
Where did those protestors buy petrol
to burn the Hindi Federation building?

780
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,500
Instead of investigating that...

781
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:44,291
...you're securing more funds for them?

782
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,291
Please do your job, sir!

783
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:53,041
Know where these were found, sir?

784
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:59,791
I went to a petrol bunk to get some,
saying I need it for an Anti-Hindi protest.

785
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,000
I said I was going to burn down
your party's office.

786
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,291
No one asked for money.

787
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:06,375
They gave it for free, and told me
to burn down a few buses and trains too!

788
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:07,791
Mr. Chief Minister!

789
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,250
Your own people are at war with you.

790
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:12,750
If you don't pick up arms...

791
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,250
...they'll finish you.

792
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,375
We need to fight back!

793
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,791
Monitor all phone calls, telegrams
and letters.

794
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:25,125
Heads of postal, telegraph and telephone
departments of the state are here.

795
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,916
Flag any communication
which seems suspicious!

796
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:32,125
We need to keep a close eye on anyone
who are with the Tamil protestors, yes?

797
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,750
No, no.

798
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:34,875
Everyone!

799
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,875
Our ministers, government officials,
civil servants...

800
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,500
Monitor everyone who has a telephone.

801
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,750
Then what about the Chief Minister?

802
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,666
Even my residence, kid?

803
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,375
Your residence alone has five telephones.

804
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,541
That's where I intend to start!

805
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,375
Sir?

806
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:56,791
This is war!

807
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:04,875
A call from Chidambaram
on the PP call line. Proceed.

808
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,041
Hello?
-Hello?

809
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,166
Hello? I hear you, Ratna.
Go ahead.

810
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,916
They've begun searching relentlessly.

811
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:14,916
Didn't think it'd happen so quickly.

812
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,166
Who? The Madras Police?

813
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:20,250
No. Some demonic officer who came over
from Delhi to investigate this!

814
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,125
He threatened all of us!

815
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:26,875
He correctly deduced this news was leaked
by the National Radio!

816
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,250
You be on your guard, Ratna.

817
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:31,375
Let me know if you hear anything else.
Got it?

818
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:43,416
He's cleaned up nicely!

819
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Who was on the phone?

820
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:48,875
I'm the teacher.

821
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,375
I ask the questions here.

822
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,750
Head up.

823
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,750
'O precious pearl...'

824
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,750
'O precious pearl...'

825
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:49,166
'My heart's all a flutter'

826
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:53,250
'The ailment of love
is at my door'

827
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,750
Broke into my house, have you?

828
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,875
Had he seen you...

829
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,916
You old crone!
Today is Ugadi!

830
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,291
I've brought sweet custard!

831
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,791
I painstakingly made it myself!

832
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,916
Try it and let me know how it is!

833
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Hey!

834
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,500
Careful with my pail!

835
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,875
Little one!

836
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,875
Why is the custard
coming all the way to the bed?

837
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,625
True, grandma!
I've never heard her talk like this.

838
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,250
Something's not right.

839
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:21,125
Get that custard!

840
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
He drank it all!

841
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,125
Grandma! The cow gave birth yesterday,
right?

842
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,791
Yes!
What about it?

843
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,916
Pour the colostrum in that pail!

844
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:49,791
They'll think ill of us
if we return an empty vessel!

845
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:53,000
What do we care if they think ill of us?

846
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:54,250
Come here, you old crone!

847
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:55,875
What?

848
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:58,500
You'll have to go there someday
to discuss marriage!

849
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Come!

850
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,250
Oh my goodness!

851
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,416
Fine, I'll make some!
Go give it to them!

852
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:09,125
Why must I give it?

853
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,000
Tell the one who drank the custard
to do it!

854
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:12,125
Can't you do any chore?

855
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,375
Don't scold him, grandma!

856
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:15,791
He's an engineer.

857
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:17,625
I'll go give it.

858
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,500
How'd you figure it out?

859
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,500
Like it's rocket science!

860
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,541
She says it's Ugadi
in the wrong month!

861
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,625
He drinks up custard
without brushing his teeth!

862
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,416
Just to go next door,
he takes a bath!

863
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,000
Hurry!
-(Hindi) Is it "She came"?

864
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,250
(Hindi) Or "He came"?

865
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,416
(Hindi) Can a chair mend himself?

866
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,375
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

867
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,500
How many times do I tell you?

868
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:57,666
Chair is of feminine gender.
Bed is masculine gender!

869
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,375
Are the chair and bed
looking to have babies together?

870
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,250
Why look at gender there?

871
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,666
Just follow my instructions!

872
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,291
Next one!
Quickly!

873
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:11,416
I need to leave soon.

874
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:14,666
For what?

875
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,250
A woman has a thousand errands
at any moment!

876
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,000
Should I check with you
before doing them?

877
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,041
Understood.

878
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:27,250
You got some protesting to do
with that damn Durai!

879
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,375
Don't talk about your brother!

880
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,625
He's out there fighting valiantly!

881
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,250
And look at you!
Moron of the highest order!

882
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:37,416
(Telugu) Knucklehead!

883
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:38,875
(Hindi) Scaredy cat!

884
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,125
(Hindi) Scaredy cat, eh?

885
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,375
That means coward, right?

886
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:45,875
Jeez...
-Right?

887
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:47,875
(Telugu) O dear God...

888
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,500
(Hindi) Greetings, sir!
Have a good day!

889
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,750
(Hindi) What brings you here?

890
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:53,875
You said that perfectly!

891
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,541
You really are in a royal mess!

892
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,791
Like Rajaji went to learn Hindi
from Mahatma Gandhi's son...

893
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:02,666
...this Member of Parliament's daughter
is the best you could find?

894
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,125
Sure, let's go with that!

895
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:09,500
Something funny?

896
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:13,000
Rajaji ended up not learning
even a single word of Hindi!

897
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:17,750
Then what was Gandhi's son doing
instead of teaching him Hindi?

898
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:19,500
Hindi, Schmindi!

899
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,416
He wooed Rajaji's daughter
and married her!

900
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,250
I see...
-Chezhiya!

901
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,875
Heard you're getting married too!

902
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:29,375
Your grandmother seems to be scouring
the town for a Hindi speaking girl...

903
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,916
...as you're about to land a job in Delhi!

904
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,416
She asked me about it too.

905
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:35,875
Sir!

906
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,500
Let me know if you know any good girls!

907
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:44,875
Can't say one word in Hindi,
and she wants a Hindi girl for him?

908
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,041
Ratnamala!
-That old crone wants the moon!

909
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,291
Stop, big shot!
-(Telugu) At this rate...

910
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:52,416
Stop, I say!
-At this rate, they'll sell us all out!

911
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,041
Hey, apprentice!

912
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:55,875
Please hear me out!

913
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,500
Way to light the fuse!

914
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:02,250
This will do for now.

915
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,750
I'll be back for my next vacation.
Be ready.

916
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,791
Will contact you
if I need more help, okay?

917
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:09,875
Ratnamala!

918
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,625
(Hindi) Get in the car.

919
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,250
(Hindi) I want to go home.

920
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:16,375
By bus.

921
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:18,625
That's where I'm headed too!

922
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,000
Good freaking grief!

923
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,166
Hey lady... It doesn't look like
you're going home.

924
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:39,291
(Hindi) I want to go home!

925
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,875
You'd dare marry another girl
and bring her here?

926
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,541
I'll kill you!

927
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,541
Couldn't you have said so earlier?

928
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:58,666
(Telugu) Right...

929
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,250
Yeah, right!

930
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:01,875
How was I to know?

931
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,750
That you'd think of another girl
other than me!

932
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:09,041
(Telugu) How could you even think
of marrying another girl, tosser?

933
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:22,666
I'll learn Telugu as well!

934
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:48,500
'You caress my heart and depart'

935
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:50,750
'O tidal wave'

936
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,375
'You steal gazes
before taking to the skies'

937
00:55:55,416 --> 00:56:00,791
'You confine this peacock
within a cage'

938
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:03,625
'You set me ablaze
and watch it sizzle'

939
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,250
'You appeared before me
like a radiant orchid'

940
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:10,500
'It's moonlight that your eyes shower'

941
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,875
'Like a flower in the wild...'

942
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,375
'...I shall thrive by your side'

943
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,250
'You caress my heart and depart'

944
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,166
'O tidal wave'

945
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,666
'You steal gazes
before taking to the skies'

946
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,375
'Day after day...'

947
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,000
'You toot like a train'

948
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:11,041
'You twirl like a peacock'

949
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:14,750
'Spare me your tall tales'

950
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:17,000
'Do away with all these lies'

951
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,791
'A girl's heart, can bear it not'

952
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:21,916
'Do not bury it all
in a bed of flowers'

953
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:26,375
'You devoured me entire, O deer'

954
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:30,125
'You caress my heart and depart'

955
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,875
'O tidal wave'

956
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,416
'You steal gazes
before taking to the skies'

957
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,375
'Like a flower in the wild...'

958
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,125
'...I shall thrive by your side'

959
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:47,625
'You confine this peacock
within a cage'

960
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,875
'You set me ablaze
and watch it sizzle'

961
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,666
'Upon your spine...'

962
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:10,041
'...shall I flow like a river?'

963
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,000
'Shall I weave together blooms
with the caress of my fingers?'

964
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:18,625
'Even when you play a game of cards,
only I shall be the Queen of Hearts'

965
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,166
'A comrade, you may be...
But I shan't spare your life'

966
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,500
'I shall forever be...'

967
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:27,875
'...an earring,
hanging on your word'

968
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,416
'You confine this peacock
within a cage'

969
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,625
'You set me ablaze
and watch it sizzle'

970
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:41,291
'You appeared before me
like a radiant orchid'

971
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:43,541
'It's moonlight that your eyes shower'

972
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,416
'Like a flower in the wild...'

973
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,791
'...I shall thrive by your side'

974
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:54,500
'You confine this peacock
within a cage'

975
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:57,166
'You set me ablaze
and watch it sizzle'

976
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,125
He waited all day at the assembly
for you, sir.

977
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,875
He came home first thing in the morning!

978
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,375
Per the intel I received,
black flags will fly here on January 26th.

979
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:22,916
I need your signature
to ensure it doesn't happen.

980
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:25,625
You're going to Madurai
to inaugurate Hindi Week, yes?

981
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,375
There'll surely be resistance.

982
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,625
I'll take care of that, dear boy.

983
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,125
You take care of things in Madras.

984
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:37,750
What's going on in this country, brother?

985
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,000
Tamilians are dying in a famine
like no other!

986
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,041
If we ask for grains to eat...

987
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,500
..the central government stuffs Hindi
down our throats!

988
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,791
Down with that!

989
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:47,916
At ease!

990
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,875
What is tomorrow's headlines, Mr. Karuna?

991
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:01,750
Rise up, brother!

992
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,375
It's time to go to war!

993
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,250
Ten paise.

994
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:13,500
Pick up tomorrow's edition of 'Sudar'
at the stand and read it yourself!

995
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Keep the change.

996
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,541
You dare try to burn down
the constitution?

997
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,625
Call it baptism by fire!

998
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,625
As January 26th marks Republic Day...

999
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,125
If the police don't permit us
to raise black flags that day...

1000
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,750
...I suggest we raise black flags
in our own homes!

1001
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,750
Comrades!
-You're under arrest, sir!

1002
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,416
I urge you all to do so!
-For treason!

1003
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:45,375
You can shut down this press.

1004
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,375
The same story is being printed
in thirteen presses!

1005
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:51,166
How will you shut that down, son?

1006
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:54,750
When the sun rises,
the drums will roar, for sure!

1007
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:58,666
Now!

1008
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,500
It's okay!
I'll handle this.

1009
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,875
I'll handle it! Travel safe!
-Come peacefully, sir!

1010
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Shall we go?

1011
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,541
This arrest shouldn't be
on any official record.

1012
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:14,000
Yes, sir.
-Keep moving him.

1013
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:17,125
Four days later,
throw him into the Palayamkottai Jail.

1014
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:21,500
You're going for your interview
after paying Chinna's college fees?

1015
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,541
Make sure you pray.

1016
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:28,041
O dear Gods, please band together
and be by my grandson's side.

1017
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,500
Take good care of him!

1018
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:32,750
When you come back,
it will be with a job!

1019
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,666
You think so?

1020
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,750
If they could arrest our leader overnight,
think what they'll do to us!

1021
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:39,416
So what if we have no leader?

1022
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:40,541
We'll do it ourselves!

1023
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:43,000
At the party office entrance
in Maasi Street, Madurai!

1024
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:46,625
No matter who gets in the way,
we burn their party flag right there!

1025
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,791
Who will burn it?
We asked across the entire district!

1026
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:50,916
No one wants to do it!

1027
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,375
I'll burn it.

1028
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,750
They'll arrest you for treason!

1029
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:56,500
They'll target and destroy
your family!

1030
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:58,916
A few years ago, the Puranaanooru Squad...

1031
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:01,500
...burned down a train
and rolled back Hindi imposition!

1032
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:02,666
We're just like them!

1033
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,125
I say we proceed!

1034
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,666
Even if I die,
I die a warrior!

1035
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,291
All hail Warrior Chinnadurai!

1036
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:09,666
All hail Warrior Chinnadurai!
-Hey!

1037
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,750
Who are you guys?
What's happening here?

1038
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:14,500
"Who are we"? Members of
Madurai's Anti-Hindi imposition squad!

1039
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:15,791
Who the hell are you?

1040
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:20,250
Your precious comrade who's all
'consequences be damned' over there?

1041
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,416
His big brother!

1042
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:24,416
Please understand
what we're fighting for...

1043
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,416
Don't get in the middle
of our family issue. Go!

1044
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,625
Fine, beat yourselves to death!

1045
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,875
What's with you, sir?

1046
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,625
You have a home, get meals on time,
good clothes and money whenever you want!

1047
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,625
So, you feel privileged enough to protest!

1048
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,125
Know how much these kids' parents struggle
to educate them?

1049
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,375
Considered their future?

1050
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,666
Expect us to learn Hindi
and become sycophants like you?

1051
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,666
That's my fate.

1052
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,250
You just focus on studying!

1053
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,166
No one here can get a job!

1054
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,375
Then why do we need to pay college fees?

1055
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,875
Why'd you rip the demand draft?

1056
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,375
Stop it, brother!
-Why'd you rip it?

1057
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,041
Don't you know the value of education?

1058
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:08,291
Brother!

1059
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:09,875
Durai!

1060
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,041
No, brother!
Don't do it!

1061
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,375
Durai!
-Don't!

1062
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:17,916
Don't fight!

1063
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:21,000
You call yourself a leader?

1064
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:23,875
Did you bloody think about your followers?

1065
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
No, brother!

1066
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,250
Let's see how you protest!
-Don't do it, brother!

1067
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,125
I'd rather see you be crippled
than lie dead in the street!

1068
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,125
Durai!

1069
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,500
Your leader's leg is broken!

1070
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,000
He must be bedridden for 45 days!
All protests cancelled!

1071
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:43,000
I'll head straight to Maasi Street
after my interview!

1072
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,500
If I see any of you there...

1073
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:47,166
...I'll bury you all where you stand!

1074
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,625
Just eat and only focus on studying!

1075
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:51,875
Eat!

1076
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,625
Give me a hand!
-Get him to the hospital!

1077
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,750
Let's get him to the hospital!
-Go easy on his leg!

1078
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,875
Hurry! Come on!
-Lift him up!

1079
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:10,791
Can't you watch your step?

1080
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:13,625
Hey! Don't fall on the tracks!
-My pen, brother!

1081
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,041
Buy another one!

1082
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,625
I don't have money for that.

1083
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,000
I only have enough
for a return ticket after my exam!

1084
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,250
What exam, Ayyakannu?

1085
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,375
The Union Public Service Commission exam.

1086
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,791
This is my first trip to Madras!

1087
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:34,291
Didn't know the route,
and got lost!

1088
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,875
I'm running late!
This is my last shot!

1089
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,250
The stress makes me feel
I forgot everything I studied!

1090
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,041
Here!

1091
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:45,541
This is a very lucky pen!

1092
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:47,000
The great Anna gifted it to me!

1093
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:48,291
Do well!

1094
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:52,750
Brother!

1095
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,625
Brother!

1096
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:58,500
Thanks! I'll return it in the evening!
-You better!

1097
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:01,000
Don't drop it on the tracks!
-I'll definitely return it!

1098
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,250
I'll be the first collector
from my town! Just watch!

1099
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:06,875
When do you head back?

1100
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I take the evening Boat Mail Express
once I'm done.

1101
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,291
Very well.

1102
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:11,500
What about your pen?

1103
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:13,791
I'll leave it at this counter
at 4 PM!

1104
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:16,166
You better keep it, okay?
-I will, brother!

1105
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,750
Come! Get on this bus
and get off at Panagal Park!

1106
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,375
Your exam center will be close by!

1107
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,125
Hurry!
-Thank you very much, brother!

1108
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:29,375
Those who are elder must be addressed
as 'aap' (you honorific).

1109
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,375
And those younger
must be addressed as 'tum' (you).

1110
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,125
And it's 'ithar aoongi'
(I'll be there).

1111
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,000
No, you're mistaken.

1112
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,875
As you're a male,
it should be...

1113
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,541
...it should be 'aoonga'.
My mistake, sir.

1114
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:43,666
I'll correct it, sir.

1115
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,291
Sorry. You are not eligible.

1116
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:48,875
Sir...

1117
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:50,625
Why, sir?

1118
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,250
Didn't I answer correctly
in the job-related questions?

1119
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,375
Your Hindi is very weak.

1120
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:59,250
The other candidates...
Nikhil, Amit, and Keshav...

1121
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:02,750
They've scored very well
in the written and oral Hindi tests.

1122
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,000
You are unemployable.

1123
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,625
Mr. Che... Chezeeyan.

1124
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,125
Better luck next time.

1125
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:09,416
Sir...

1126
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,500
Sir...

1127
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:12,791
I swear I don't get it.

1128
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:16,041
You said knowing Hindi was good enough
to land this job.

1129
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:18,166
But now, you expect me
to speak fluently like them?

1130
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:19,291
How is this fair?

1131
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,625
They've been speaking it
since birth.

1132
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,500
I've only been learning
for a little while.

1133
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,125
There's bound to be a difference, yes?

1134
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,500
Even you couldn't pronounce my name
properly.

1135
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:31,625
Does it mean you're unemployable?
No, right?

1136
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,625
I put in a lot of effort for six months
to learn this language.

1137
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,625
I'll pick it up on the job, sir.

1138
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:39,000
I speak English well, sir.

1139
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,125
So what?

1140
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,541
We've even asked
the English-speaking President...

1141
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,375
...to address the Parliament
in Hindi.

1142
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,625
You should change too!

1143
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:49,666
Mister! Per the Official Languages Act,
it's compulsory to learn Hindi fluently!

1144
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:53,625
From the Supreme Court to Civil Service
exams, everything will be in Hindi.

1145
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:55,166
Within one year...

1146
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:58,916
...the nameboards of every bus stand,
railway station in South India...

1147
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,500
...will be written in Hindi.

1148
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:02,875
Instead of giving excuses...

1149
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,125
...learn Hindi fluently
and try again. We'll see.

1150
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,875
Mr. Chay-Zhee-An.

1151
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:08,875
Next!
-Sir...

1152
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,375
No, sir...
I can do it better.

1153
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,500
Give me just one chance.
I'll learn it, sir.

1154
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:14,916
Next!
-One chance...

1155
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,750
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1156
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:47,166
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1157
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:50,291
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1158
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:54,500
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1159
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,000
Sir!
-Hold it right there!

1160
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,875
Sir!
-Stop him!

1161
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Sir!

1162
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,166
Hey! Get up!
-Sir!

1163
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,500
Sir!
-Get up!

1164
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:03,375
I came to take my last crack
at the IAS exam.

1165
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,750
They had postponed it by two months,
sent us all home...

1166
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:07,875
...and said the exam would be conducted
in Hindi!

1167
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Son...

1168
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:13,250
The National Language Committee is yet
to decide if English can be added...

1169
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:15,875
...along with Hindi as the medium
for IAS exams.

1170
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,541
Please wait until it is publicly announced,
son.

1171
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:20,875
Don't be hasty.

1172
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,750
What if the committee says the exam
will only be in Hindi?

1173
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:26,875
So what?
You can still write the exam in English!

1174
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:33,666
They've announced that
you can get a job in the quota system.

1175
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,000
We studied in the Tamil medium, sir.

1176
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,125
It took us 200 years to learn English!

1177
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:41,291
Who knows how long it will take
to learn yet another language?

1178
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,166
We think in Tamil and write in English.

1179
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:45,500
We have to check
for spelling mistakes ten times over!

1180
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:48,375
But Hindi speakers? It's easy,
as it's their mother tongue.

1181
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,250
They're rigging everything
in their favor!

1182
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,625
Shouldn't you speak for us
as our representative, sir?

1183
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,541
I beg of you, sir.
Do not forsake us!

1184
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,750
Toss this lunatic out!
-Do not forsake us, sir!

1185
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:00,375
Get up! Let's get going!
-Sir!

1186
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,500
Sir!

1187
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,625
Come on!
-I'm not a lunatic, sir!

1188
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,250
Please hear me out, sir!

1189
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,416
Poor lad!

1190
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,500
"Hindi imposition burnt down
the only dream I had."

1191
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:01,916
"Your language politics
burnt down my future."

1192
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:04,625
"Your arrogant power
burnt down my life."

1193
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:08,125
"The useless shell that's left behind?
I shall burn it myself!"

1194
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,750
"Yours truly,
R. Ayyakannu."

1195
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:34,875
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1196
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,750
Move aside!
-Long Live the Chief Minister!

1197
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,125
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1198
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:39,541
Where is your chief?

1199
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:43,625
The Chief Minister said
Madras must remain quiet.

1200
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:46,416
Our chief is on his way
after enforcing that.

1201
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:48,291
(Madurai - 7 Kilometres)

1202
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,750
Step on it!

1203
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,375
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1204
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,791
(Telugu) Please turn that frown
upside down, dear.

1205
01:10:56,916 --> 01:11:00,791
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1206
01:11:00,916 --> 01:11:04,291
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1207
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:07,250
It's just students who are protesting,
right?

1208
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,750
Why not let them, sir?
Aren't you a Tamilian, too?

1209
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,166
Pull over.

1210
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:12,791
Sir?

1211
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,416
I said so in Tamil, didn't I?

1212
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,166
Pull over.
-Sir...

1213
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,375
Yes, sir.

1214
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,166
Sir? Sir!
No, sir!

1215
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,625
Sir!

1216
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,541
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1217
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:41,625
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1218
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:45,916
They've shut factories for ink and dyeing
as well as textile mills in Madurai, buddy!

1219
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:47,625
We don't have black cloth, paper or ink!

1220
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,875
How do we protest now?

1221
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,500
We're surrounded by cops!
Let's leave!

1222
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:52,625
Come here, child.

1223
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,125
Black...

1224
01:11:58,791 --> 01:11:59,791
Get lost!

1225
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:04,916
Everyone will take notice of
the black flags that fly in the sky today.

1226
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,541
At ease!

1227
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:12,000
Do you know why I came to Madurai
to inaugurate Hindi Week?

1228
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:16,250
I believe the very Madurai where
the Sangam movement propagated Tamil...

1229
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:20,666
...will also propagate Hindi
which will unite our country!

1230
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:22,916
At ease!

1231
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:30,375
From now, the official language of India
is no longer English!

1232
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,666
To enforce that, I rechristen
the Indian Gazette to 'Bharat Rajpatra'.

1233
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:38,875
Under that name,
I release its inaugural Hindi edition!

1234
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:40,875
Praise be to India!

1235
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,500
(Hindi) The Hindi Week begins!

1236
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,500
(Hindi) The Hindi Week begins!

1237
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,250
(Hindi) The Hindi Week begins!

1238
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:51,000
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1239
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:54,375
I saw a gang of students
break into the bank, sir!

1240
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,875
Let them be trapped in there.

1241
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,791
Do nothing as long as the CM is here.
Got it?

1242
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,000
Do what you want to them
once he leaves.

1243
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:08,416
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1244
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:13,500
Long Live the Chief Minister!

1245
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,750
Long Live Tamil!
-Long Live Tamil!

1246
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:20,125
Long Live Tamil!
-Long Live Tamil!

1247
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,750
Carbon paper?

1248
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,125
Long Live Tamil!

1249
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:24,750
Long Live Tamil!

1250
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,000
Long Live Tamil!

1251
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:28,875
Long Live Tamil!

1252
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,250
Long Live Tamil!

1253
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:31,625
Long Live Tamil!

1254
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,875
Move aside!
-Come quickly!

1255
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Move!
-Hold it!

1256
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:50,875
Hold him tight!

1257
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:54,416
Hold him tight!

1258
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,916
'Fire up your intellect
and make your foes tremble'

1259
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:13,791
'Sharpen your core
and erupt like a volcano'

1260
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,375
'Ours is a great army'

1261
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,625
'Bear witness, for ours is a great army'

1262
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:34,625
Get him!

1263
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,500
So you'd arrest us if we raise black flags?

1264
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:42,041
Our hair is black, too!

1265
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,916
Arrest us if you dare!

1266
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,125
Can your prison even contain so many of us,
Mr. CM?

1267
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:57,291
'Fire up your intellect
and make your foes tremble'

1268
01:14:57,416 --> 01:15:00,291
'Sharpen your core
and erupt like a volcano'

1269
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:02,250
'Ours is a great army'

1270
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,625
'Bear witness, for ours is a great army'

1271
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:27,416
'Fire up your intellect
and make your foes tremble'

1272
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:30,625
'Sharpen your core
and erupt like a volcano'

1273
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,125
'Ours is a great army'

1274
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,000
'Bear witness, for ours is a great army'

1275
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:38,541
Light it up, brother!

1276
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
We'll show them!

1277
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:04,500
This revolution will spread!

1278
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:05,625
It will rage!

1279
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,541
It will rage on!
-It will rage on!

1280
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:11,291
Long Live Tamil!

1281
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:12,416
Long Live Tamil!

1282
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,125
Don't go in there, sir!

1283
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,291
Let go of me!

1284
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:42,875
Come on!
This way!

1285
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:45,416
Hurry!
-Come on!

1286
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,500
Come on!

1287
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,125
You had 'Puranaanooru'
tattooed on your chest!

1288
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,000
You're the leader of that squad!

1289
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,875
Get going!
Take cover in Chidambaram!

1290
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Get in quickly, Durai!

1291
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:18,125
Be safe, Poovai!

1292
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,166
Get going! Step on it
and head to Chidambaram!

1293
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:34,541
What you said the other day?

1294
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,125
The same MO as the 1959 incident.

1295
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:38,750
Diethyl.

1296
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,166
Arsonism.

1297
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:41,875
The same man.

1298
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,500
(Let justice prevail)

1299
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:45,666
He's back.

1300
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,541
'Fire up your intellect

01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,625
'Bear witness, for ours is a great army'

1304
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:08,250
Why are you mad at me?

1305
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,625
Like you don't know!

1306
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,875
Why did you keep this from me?

1307
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,500
I didn't tell anyone.

1308
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,166
I'm not just 'anyone'.
I'm Ratnamala!

1309
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:22,291
Ratnamala!

1310
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,250
Ratnamala!

1311
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,750
Ratnamala!

1312
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,791
Is she your dear brother Chinnadurai
to forgive you so easily?

1313
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:31,041
You and your lies!

1314
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:32,250
Way to screw up, Chief!

1315
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,375
Talk to her in Telugu.

1316
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:46,500
Are you really that naive?

1317
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,500
You should learn all this, Chief!

1318
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,500
'Ratnamala...'

1319
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
'Ratnamala...'

1320
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:05,500
(Telugu) 'Part not from me'

1321
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,250
'Ratnamala...'

1322
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,416
'Ratnamala...'

1323
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,000
(Telugu) 'The moon parts not from the sky'

1324
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,375
(Telugu) Picked up Telugu, eh?

1325
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,250
(Telugu) How can I not?
For you, Ratnamala!

1326
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:23,000
'Why does the world spin
round and round?'

1327
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,250
'Why does it crumble apart?'

1328
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:31,375
'Like a note scribbled in a book...'

1329
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,125

to paint my love?'

'Ratnamala...'

1358
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,250
'Eyelashes part not from the eyes'

1359
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,250
'O beauty...'

1360
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:05,791

1361
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:10,125
'...seeps in a soft smile'

1362
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:17,250

'Why don't you exchange places?'

1366
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:44,416
'Till the moment I caress you,
I'm nothing but this letter's paper'

1367
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,791
The telegram just arrived, right?

1368
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:02,041
We'll handle it!
Go!

1369
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:05,625
A telegram from A. Ramasamy,
the head of Madurai University.

1370
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:07,625
At the attack in Maasi street...

1371
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:10,250
...two student comrades
passed away.

1372
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,916
The ruling party goons
brutally attacked students!

1373
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:15,041
The cops stood back and watched!

1374
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:18,500
We're doing a citywide procession
against police brutality tomorrow!

1375
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:20,875
We got authorization!
We're going!

1376
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
We're going!
-Durai!

1377
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:23,916
How'd they give permission
on Republic Day?

1378
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:28,666
The law gives carte blanche to the cops
for any riots on Republic Day.

1379
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:30,500
That's why they signed off in a jiffy!

1380
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:31,875
They're luring us into a trap!

1381
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:34,875
I don't care!
They attacked students!

1382
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:37,250
I'm going.
-We'll go on a procession.

1383
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:38,500
But on January 27th!

1384
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,375
What's deemed illegal on Republic Day
is a democratic right on the next day!

1385
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,625
But neither you nor the Maasi Street crew
need to come.

1386
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:46,500
They're hunting you
even as we speak.

1387
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:47,750
I'll go get permission.

1388
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:49,375
Forget what happened at Maasi Street!

1389
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,000
Only peaceful protests from now!

1390
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,291
That won't cut it, brother.

1391
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,666
Violence is all they understand.

1392
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:00,000
I lost a friend because I was
more violent than you!

1393
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:02,375
This is war!
There will be casualties!

1394
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,541
Not just Netaji! Didn't proponents of
Gandhiji's non-violence also die?

1395
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,000
Fear won't accomplish crap!

1396
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,500
Durai...
Don't mistake caution with fear.

1397
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:11,625
It's wisdom.

1398
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,500
You've used every weapon you have.

1399
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:15,791
Leave this to me.

1400
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:20,000
All our squads will hold processions
in every district on the 27th at 9 AM!

1401
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:22,125
I'll handle it.
Please don't step out!

1402
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Alright.

1403
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,916
As my brother,
I don't have to listen to you.

1404
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,416
But as my leader,
I have no choice.

1405
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,375
Call immediately if anything comes up
on National Radio.

1406
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,625
One of us will always be by the phone.
-Okay.

1407
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,500
Start the van, Soda!

1408
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:05,500
I told you to give authorization
to those students. Why'd you cancel it?

1409
01:25:05,625 --> 01:25:07,375
We didn't cancel it.
They did.

1410
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,250
The students postponed
their mourning procession to the 27th.

1411
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:12,500
We can do nothing to them that day.

1412
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:15,041
We have shooting orders for tomorrow
as it's Republic Day.

1413
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:18,000
But to get it for the day after tomorrow,
we need to invoke Section 144.

1414
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:20,125
We need the Chief Minister
to sign off on it.

1415
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:22,666
He picked up the scent!

1416
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,500
Smart bugger!

1417
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:34,666
Did the CM answer our call?
-No.

1418
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:38,666
We're making sketches of the Maasi Street
perpetrators. We're searching intensely.

1419
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,500
I'll get the shooting order.

1420
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,666
Rubber bullets, blank rounds,
tear gas... They're all ready, right?

1421
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,166
Yes, sir.

1422
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,250
The CM isn't taking my calls
ever since the Maasi Street Incident.

1423
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:59,000
He wouldn't give me an appointment too.

1424
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:00,375
Will he give a firing order?

1425
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:09,166
You did this knowing Ratna is my daughter?

1426
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:15,750
We've recorded several phone calls...

1427
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,416
...from your house to Annamalai University
in Chidambaram.

1428
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:20,875
Treason.

1429
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Sedition.
Life time imprisonment.

1430
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,125
As it's your daughter, I came personally,
instead of sending a police force.

1431
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:33,750
Press, First Information Reports,
this and that... it'll be embarrassing.

1432
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,750
Hello?
-It's Baskar Rao, chief.

1433
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:56,916
Baskar Rao...

1434
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:01,000
Let's invoke Section 144
at Chidambaram, chief.

1435
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:04,875
Why do that now?

1436
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:09,625
Those students are just conducting
a mourning procession.

1437
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:11,875
That's why.

1438
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:14,791
Much like the how they burned down
the Hindi Federation...

1439
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,500
...we have reliable intel
that they intend to burn...

1440
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:20,500
...the post office, the telephone exchange
and the railway station.

1441
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:22,125
All central government facilities!

1442
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:25,125
Who's the source?

1443
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:27,791
Our youth wing students
at that college.

1444
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,250
Inform the district magistrate...

1445
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:36,500
...and have them telex the order copy
to me.

1446
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,041
Yes, chief.

1447
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:52,625
Had the CM picked up when I called...

1448
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:55,125
...I wouldn't have bothered you, sir.

1449
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:01,916
What is this?

1450
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,500
(Telugu) What the hell?

1451
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:07,750
(Telugu) What the...
-Stop, miss!

1452
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:09,500
(Telugu) Even after everything?

1453
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,791
(Telugu) Just one call, dad!
-Please listen!

1454
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:14,250
This is for the students' future, dad!

1455
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:16,125
You matter more to me
than anything else.

1456
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,250
(Telugu) Dad...
-Come.

1457
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,000
(Telugu) Please, dad.

1458
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:20,875
(Telugu) Go to bed.
-(Telugu) Please, dad!

1459
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,166
(Telugu) Dad!

1460
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:25,750
(Telugu) Keep her in there!

1461
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:28,375
For your bet... betrayal of Tamil...

1462
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,375
...your party
will never come back to power, dad!

1463
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:50,500
Tie it tightly.

1464
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:53,541
This too.

1465
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:57,041
Even higher if you can!

1466
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:02,416
Brother...

1467
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:17,916
Chezhiyan isn't here yet.

1468
01:29:18,041 --> 01:29:19,500
We don't have authorization.

1469
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:25,125
Whether we have it or not, our squads will
take to the streets everywhere at 9 AM!

1470
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,125
There are millions of students!

1471
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:31,500
How many people can they kill?

1472
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:35,291
I'm going.
Let's see what they can do!

1473
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,375
Your brother told us not to go!

1474
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:39,750
He said he'd get authorization too!

1475
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:40,875
Did he succeed?

1476
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,375
We'll join you!
-Hey, dummy!

1477
01:29:43,875 --> 01:29:45,375
Want all of us to get caught?

1478
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,416
We have a lot more to accomplish!

1479
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:52,666
Stay here.

1480
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:55,000
I'll go finish this.

1481
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:56,750
We'll accomplish the rest together.

1482
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:03,291
It's 8:55, sir!
We only have five minutes!

1483
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:05,375
The Collector agreed to authorize this.

1484
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,416
Five minutes left, yes?
Wait.

1485
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,375
(Telugu) Come on! Come on! Come on!

1486
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,791
The arrogance of Hindi oppressors
is alive and kicking!

1487
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:18,750
It is alive and kicking!

1488
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,250
Law must prevail
and curb their arrogance!

1489
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,541
Law must prevail
and curb their arrogance!

1490
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:24,750
Long Live Tamil!

1491
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:27,000
Long Live Tamil!
-Victory to Tamilians!

1492
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:29,375
These people permitted
a mourning procession.

1493
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,125
But they also invoked Section 144.

1494
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:34,125
Who's insane? Them or those of us
who work for them? I have no idea!

1495
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:39,541
"But they also invoked Section 144."

1496
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:47,125
Everyone leave!
Students are going to riot!

1497
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,166
Close the shops!
Everyone leave!

1498
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:53,666
We will keep fighting!
We will keep fighting for Tamil!

1499
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:57,250
We will keep fighting!
We will keep fighting for Tamil!

1500
01:30:57,375 --> 01:31:00,250
We will keep fighting!
We will keep fighting for Tamil!

1501
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:03,291
Long Live Tamil!

1502
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:07,416
If your issue is with the government,
go to Delhi and protest!

1503
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:09,750
Did Gandhi do the Salt Satyagraha Movement
in London?

1504
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:11,500
Is Delhi the only part of India?

1505
01:31:11,625 --> 01:31:13,125
Is Chidambaram in China?

1506
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:17,666
Long Live The Republic!
Long Live India!

1507
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:19,000
Long Live India!

1508
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:20,625
Long Live Tamil!
-Palaniappan?

1509
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,750
Sir?

1510
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,250
Long Live Tamil!
-Let them pass.

1511
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:24,375
Sir?

1512
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,625
Let them pass, I say.

1513
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,416
Long Live The Republic!
-Yes, sir.

1514
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:28,666
Open it up! Let them pass!

1515
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:30,791
Long Live Tamil!

1516
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:43,375
We will keep fighting!
We will keep fighting for Tamil!

1517
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,375
We will keep fighting!
We will keep fighting for Tamil!

1518
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,500
Brother!
-Brother!

1519
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:51,750
They already left!

1520
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:53,000
Durai left with them!
-Yes!

1521
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:54,875
We tried to stop him,
but he didn't listen!

1522
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,916
Brother!

1523
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,250
None of you come along!

1524
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,375
Stay here!
-Listen, brother!

1525
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,666
Do not impose!
Do not impose Hindi!

1526
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:09,625
Do not snatch away the rights
of Tamilians!

1527
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,166
We will keep fighting!

1528
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,291
We will keep fighting for Tamil!
-Hurry!

1529
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:14,500
Lock the gate!

1530
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:17,416
Do not snatch away the rights
of Tamilians!

1531
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:18,666
Close it quickly!

1532
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,375
We will keep fighting!
-Hold them off!

1533
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,791
We will keep fighting for Tamil!

1534
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:24,250
Do not impose Hindi!

1535
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:25,875
Do not snatch away our rights!

1536
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,875
The procession is going along peacefully,
sir.

1537
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,291
He's coming peacefully, too.

1538
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,125
Are you sure he's our target?

1539
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:33,250
He most definitely is not.

1540
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,291
Load this.

1541
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,416
Shoot him in the chest.

1542
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:37,875
Sir...

1543
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,416
This isn't a rubber bullet.

1544
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:41,375
It's .303 caliber high velocity bullets!

1545
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,500
It'll kill him!

1546
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:45,000
We're not sure that he's our target, right?

1547
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:48,750
You let the one we're after
slip away at Maasi Street.

1548
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:51,416
If we nab and question him,
he'll talk!

1549
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:53,166
Shooting him might cause a huge riot!

1550
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:55,875
Not at all.
He'll never talk.

1551
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:59,416
Even the last remaining student here
won't rat that man out.

1552
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,375
Mr. Superintendent!

1553
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:08,916
Know how 150,000 Britishers ruled over
millions of Indians for 200 years?

1554
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,000
They'd only shoot once.

1555
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:15,875
But the sound of that bullet
would be heard by ten million people!

1556
01:33:16,916 --> 01:33:17,916
This is just like that.

1557
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:21,000
One outcome?
Another person like him won't rise up.

1558
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:24,541
The other?
The sound will draw him out!

1559
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:30,250
We'll keep fighting!

1560
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:32,791
We'll keep fighting for Tamil!

1561
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:33,916
Durai!

1562
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,416
There are snipers in position!

1563
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:38,541
Just rubber bullets!

1564
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:40,000
They can't fire actual bullets!

1565
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,625
Deploy tear gas.

1566
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:47,750
Fire.

1567
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:49,250
Fire!
-We will keep fighting!

1568
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,750
Won't listen, eh?
Still protesting?

1569
01:34:09,875 --> 01:34:11,000
We'll keep fighting!

1570
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:06,750
Leave!

1571
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:08,000
Trying to spook us?

1572
01:35:09,375 --> 01:35:10,375
Long Live Tamil!

1573
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:39,791
Don't fire!

1574
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:44,875
Fire!

1575
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,416
Long Live Tamil!
-Don't fire!

1576
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:47,541
Victory to Tam...

1577
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:08,250
'As the fragrance in the wind,
I'll stand strong'

1578
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:18,750
'As the fire in my brother's words,
I'll be reborn'

1579
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:20,625
Don't fire!

1580
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:23,125
Don't fire!

1581
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:26,875
Chinna!

1582
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,666
'I'll brave everything...'

1583
01:36:29,791 --> 01:36:33,541
'...for my brother's beside me'

1584
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:36,916
Chinna?
-'Let the breeze in my breath...'

1585
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:41,000
'...speak my brother's name'

1586
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:47,666
'I shall walk with pride,
knowing my brother is by my side'

1587
01:36:51,541 --> 01:36:52,750
You'll be okay!

1588
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:55,416
'Standing upon his shoulders...'

1589
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:58,541
Let's go!
-'...I shall snatch the stars'

1590
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:08,625
Move!

1591
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:09,875
Don't panic, brother.

1592
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,416
Such a puny bullet can't hurt me!

1593
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:14,000
Don't say anything!

1594
01:37:25,125 --> 01:37:26,125
Chinna?

1595
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,166
Chinna!

1596
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,541
Chinna...
-'You showed me the world'

1597
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:37,125
'I was born to be your shadow'

1598
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:41,166
Chinna?
Look at me!

1599
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:44,666
'Let's get the fireworks going'

1600
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:46,500
'Let's twirl our moustaches'

1601
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:47,666
Don't give up, brother.

1602
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:51,125
You'll be okay!

1603
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,250
Get up!

1604
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:54,666
'You are...'

1605
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:59,041
Stop!
-'You are, you are God's witness'

1606
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Sir?

1607
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:11,250
Puranaanooru!

1608
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:14,125
My younger brother, sir!

1609
01:38:15,166 --> 01:38:16,166
Sir...

1610
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,000
Let go of me!

1611
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:20,250
Let go of me, I say!

1612
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:21,375
Sir!

1613
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,000
I'm coming, Chinna!

1614
01:38:23,125 --> 01:38:25,375
He's innocent, sir! Please spare him!
Chinna!

1615
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,000
Don't be scared!
I'm coming!

1616
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,500
He's innocent, sir!
Please spare him!

1617
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:31,666
I'm coming, Chinna!

1618
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,500
He's still alive, sir!

1619
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:36,291
If we get him to a hospital,
we can save him!

1620
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,250
Get him inside!

1621
01:38:39,875 --> 01:38:40,875
'I'll brave everything'

1622
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,875
By saving him...
-'For my brother's beside me'

1623
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,791
...you expect to win
an award for Best Nurse?

1624
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:49,291
Let him go!
-'Let the breeze in my breath...'

1625
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:52,875
He's innocent!
-'...speak my brother's name'

1626
01:38:54,416 --> 01:38:59,916
'I shall walk with pride,
knowing my brother is by my side'

1627
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,750
Let him go straight to the morgue!

1628
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:11,000
'Standing upon his shoulders,
I shall snatch the stars'

1629
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,041
Chinna...

1630
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,000
A college student...

1631
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,125
...was shot to death
by his own government!

1632
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,041
This is a black day for our democracy!

1633
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:30,916
Yes, it is!
-At ease!

1634
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:32,125
At ease!

1635
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,625
The deceased isn't a student!
He was a hooligan!

1636
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,500
Despite knowing Section 144 was in effect
in Chidambaram...

1637
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:39,541
...he instigated students
to go on a procession!

1638
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:41,875
He violently attacked police officers!

1639
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,500
Do you expect us to put a medal on him?

1640
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:49,000
I can firmly say you didn't
publicly declare Section 144 was in effect!

1641
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:51,000
Those are tall tales,
honorable member!

1642
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:54,916
The student was fully aware Section 144
was in effect, when he gathered the crowd!

1643
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:56,041
That's the truth!

1644
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:59,500
You can spin it any way you like,
as that student isn't alive to deny that!

1645
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:02,375
Blaming them for your mistakes
is old politics!

1646
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,250
Yes, indeed!
-Honorable Member!

1647
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:09,041
There is nothing old or new
in politics!

1648
01:40:09,666 --> 01:40:12,250
After taking these recent incidents
into account...

1649
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:16,375
To ensure the order of peace
is in effect in our state...

1650
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,500
...and to protect our people...

1651
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:25,625
...I announce the strict enforcement
of the DIR (Defence of India Rules) Law!

1652
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,000
What?
-Mr. Chief Minister!

1653
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:31,000
The British put the DIR law in place
to suppress freedom fighters!

1654
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,541
But now, as soon as the authority
reached your grasp...

1655
01:40:33,666 --> 01:40:36,250
...you've become the very thing
you swore to destroy!

1656
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:37,375
Speak up, everyone!

1657
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,166
We severely condemn the DIR law!
-At ease!

1658
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:40,625
Who will answer for this death?

1659
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:44,166
(The Hindi song 'Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen
Sitam' plays on the radio)

1660
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,250
"Greetings."

1661
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:35,125
"Regional News.
Professor's Radio."

1662
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,666
"As teachers..."

1663
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,875
...we are quitting
from the language protests.

1664
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,250
"We regret having stood hand in hand
with students until now."

1665
01:41:44,375 --> 01:41:45,625
The student Chinnadurai...

1666
01:41:47,625 --> 01:41:49,125
Under the guise of a language war...

1667
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:53,166
"...he assembled a group
to enforce and execute his own wishes."

1668
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,041
"We condemn that."

1669
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:00,125
Tamil Professor.

1670
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:05,625
You forced me to talk like this,
you wretches!

1671
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:08,875
When our people catch a glimpse
of biriyani...

1672
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,416
...they'll let go of their dignity.

1673
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,916
You've had to eat a lot of biriyani,
I see.

1674
01:42:20,791 --> 01:42:23,625
In the name of punishment posting,
I was relegated to a sewer!

1675
01:42:24,541 --> 01:42:25,541
For six years!

1676
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:28,625
For six years,
I sought perilous missions...

1677
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:31,250
...and earned my way back to the top
like a dog!

1678
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:33,250
Did I eat biriyani?

1679
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:35,541
Or did you let me eat it?

1680
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:40,500
You? A criminal who burned down a train?
Seen as a hero!

1681
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:43,000
I, who saved lives that day?

1682
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,250
I got punished!

1683
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:50,000
But now?
Both brothers are criminals!

1684
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:53,375
You broke my trigger finger.

1685
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:55,375
They said my career was over.

1686
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:57,041
Did I give up?

1687
01:42:58,291 --> 01:43:00,750
Didn't I learn to do everything
with my left hand?

1688
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:05,250
In the same way, we ask you
to learn Hindi.

1689
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:11,750
But the two of you brothers
want to make students lazy...

1690
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,750
...and intend to hamper
the nation's progress!

1691
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,500
A gang that's against its own country!

1692
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:28,791
The Sepoy Mut...

1693
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,750
A hundred years
before the Sepoy Mutiny...

1694
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:40,291
...it was Tamilians
who first opposed the British.

1695
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:45,375
We don't need anyone to lecture us
about patriotism!

1696
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,875
You're propagating national progress?

1697
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
How is that?

1698
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:56,166
After burying our fundamental rights?

1699
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:58,416
On top of that grave?

1700
01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:08,000
Your brother lies exactly where he belongs.

1701
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:12,166
We burned a corpse
that reeked of sewer stench!

1702
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,250
I want all their names.

1703
01:44:30,666 --> 01:44:33,291
Give a statement
confessing you burned down that train.

1704
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:36,666
You only killed one brother of mine.

1705
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,125
There is an army.

1706
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,041
There is a great army.

1707
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:51,375
To protect my mother tongue...

1708
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,625
...there is a great army!

1709
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:10,875
I learned something from the KGB.

1710
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:16,166
You can't get the truth out of anyone
by relentlessly torturing them.

1711
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,750
Because beyond a point...

1712
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,750
...the brain shuts down...

1713
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:24,750
...and they'll have no idea what to do.

1714
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:26,916
They'll lose their senses!

1715
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:39,750
But I know you have no such limits.

1716
01:45:42,541 --> 01:45:45,000
No breaking point.

1717
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:48,750
So, I can do this as long as I want!

1718
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,500
Kill me.

1719
01:45:59,416 --> 01:46:02,375
You went through hell for six years
for letting me slip away once!

1720
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:06,166
Let me slip away again,
your entire life will be a living hell!

1721
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:42,625
Here.

1722
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:45,250
Stab me with it
and escape.

1723
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,500
Will you leave...

1724
01:46:58,125 --> 01:47:01,166
...or will you die at Thiru's hands
like your friend Govind did?

1725
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:16,166
Who are you people?
Tell me!

1726
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:17,500
(Hindi) Don't hit me!

1727
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:20,041
Tell me the name of the man who hit me!
I'll let you go!

1728
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:21,750
(Hindi) Please don't hit me!

1729
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:25,625
(Hindi) Please don't kill me...

1730
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:31,625
(Hindi) Listen, kid.

1731
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,291
(Hindi) This isn't your fight.

1732
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:37,500
(Hindi) The names.

1733
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:38,875
(Hindi) Please don't kill me!

1734
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,666
(Hindi) The names of your allies!

1735
01:47:42,666 --> 01:47:44,666
(Hindi) Just give me the names
of your allies!

1736
01:47:45,791 --> 01:47:46,791
(Hindi) Tell me!

1737
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:53,291
(Hindi) Please don't kill me!

1738
01:47:59,875 --> 01:48:01,625
You were my only bloody clue!

1739
01:48:11,375 --> 01:48:13,750
Your friend didn't reveal your name
till the end.

1740
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:15,916
Thiru won't follow protocol.
He'll just kill you.

1741
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:19,625
Come on.

1742
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:21,166
Go into hiding in Andhra Pradesh.

1743
01:48:22,166 --> 01:48:23,166
Trust me.

1744
01:48:23,875 --> 01:48:25,041
I'm a Tamilian too!

1745
01:48:29,375 --> 01:48:31,500
Will you tell us where Chezhiyan is or not?

1746
01:48:31,625 --> 01:48:33,500
Tell me where he is!
-Answer me!

1747
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:35,000
Where have you hidden him?

1748
01:48:35,125 --> 01:48:36,625
Tell me!
Will you tell me or not?

1749
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,125
If I arrest you all,
you'll be in jail for life!

1750
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:42,125
Don't let anyone go
until they tell us where Chezhiyan is!

1751
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:43,666
Get in the van!
-Answer me!

1752
01:48:43,791 --> 01:48:45,166
Where is Chezhiyan?

1753
01:48:45,291 --> 01:48:46,666
Tell the truth!

1754
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:48,666
Where is he?
-The great Anna studied here!

1755
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:50,291
Know what'll happen if he finds out?

1756
01:48:50,416 --> 01:48:52,250
Your precious Anna is also in jail!
Move!

1757
01:48:55,916 --> 01:48:56,916
Sir...

1758
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:00,166
I tried my hardest to stop him.

1759
01:49:14,166 --> 01:49:15,541
Who the hell are you to strike me?

1760
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,291
I'm an IB officer like you too!

1761
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:34,416
Are you and I the same?

1762
01:49:35,416 --> 01:49:36,750
Traitor!

1763
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:40,875
You hiding your grandson in here?

1764
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,125
Where are you going?
Don't go in there!

1765
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:44,916
Get up! Let's go!

1766
01:49:45,041 --> 01:49:46,375
Where's your leader?

1767
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,541
Where is Chezhiyan?
-Tell me where he is!

1768
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:49,791
Don't hit them!
-Get going!

1769
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:52,875
Whack him!

1770
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,875
I can't see!

1771
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:56,750
Move!

1772
01:49:56,875 --> 01:49:58,875
Get in!
-We're just his neighbors!

1773
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,500
Get in!
-Let us go!

1774
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:01,666
Get in!

1775
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:11,875
Hey! Get up!

1776
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:13,291
Sir?

1777
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,041
Thank you.

1778
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:22,541
(Hindi) I don't need your thanks.

1779
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:25,541
(Hindi) Your grandmother's cooking
will suffice.

1780
01:50:27,875 --> 01:50:29,125
(Hindi) Be safe, brother.

1781
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:39,791
No one here, ma'am!

1782
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:42,000
No one in this compartment, sir.
-Keep searching!

1783
01:50:42,125 --> 01:50:43,916
Check the next compartment, constable!

1784
01:50:44,041 --> 01:50:46,125
Check the engine, too!
-Yes, sir!

1785
01:50:47,125 --> 01:50:48,250
Go there!
-Okay, sir.

1786
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,125
Chezhiya!
-Chezhiya!

1787
01:51:30,625 --> 01:51:32,125
(Hindi) What the hell happened?

1788
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:34,291
The money order arrived.

1789
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
What's the plan, Che?

1790
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,875
Many Delhi University students are with us.

1791
01:51:40,375 --> 01:51:42,125
South Indians, North Indians...

1792
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:44,000
Even Fine Arts students!

1793
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,750
What's our plan?

1794
01:51:47,125 --> 01:51:48,125
It's dangerous.

1795
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,750
Tell us something we don't know!

1796
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,250
Let's go!

1797
01:51:53,625 --> 01:51:55,125
The target is the All Party Meeting.

1798
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:57,791
Just set up the stuff.
I'll handle the rest myself.

1799
01:51:57,916 --> 01:51:59,625
You don't need this hassle!
-Nonsense!

1800
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:01,250
This is a fight against oppression!

1801
01:52:01,375 --> 01:52:03,791
If we let it lie,
they'll keep escalating matters!

1802
01:52:03,916 --> 01:52:05,250
(Bengali) One by one...

1803
01:52:05,375 --> 01:52:07,250
They'll break our backbone!

1804
01:52:07,375 --> 01:52:09,916
But the Prime Minister
is at the China border, Chezhiya.

1805
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:12,625
He won't be present
at tomorrow's All Party Meeting.

1806
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:13,791
Let him stay there!

1807
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:15,250
I'm here to meet someone else!

1808
01:52:15,375 --> 01:52:16,375
Whom?

1809
01:52:17,416 --> 01:52:19,500
You think it's so easy to meet her,
Chezhiya?

1810
01:52:39,125 --> 01:52:40,416
Tear it apart!

1811
01:52:50,291 --> 01:52:52,750
All the bus boards have been changed
overnight, ma'am!

1812
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,125
What exactly have you written in Tamil?

1813
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:02,375
They're fuming!

1814
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,541
"Long Live Hindi."

1815
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:24,750
I'm Chezhiyan!

1816
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:26,000
From Madras, ma'am.

1817
01:53:28,625 --> 01:53:31,125
For just one day, we imposed a language
you don't understand.

1818
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:32,250
Much like you did!

1819
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,125
How does it taste?

1820
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:35,291
Hey, Madrasi!

1821
01:53:35,416 --> 01:53:36,625
(Hindi) Get down from there!

1822
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:38,375
These fellows don't know Hindi!

1823
01:53:39,041 --> 01:53:40,500
Brains are filled with sand!

1824
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:42,500
Duffers, ma'am!
You should arrest them!

1825
01:53:45,375 --> 01:53:47,375
(Hindi) This was our only way
to meet you, ma'am.

1826
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:51,500
(Hindi) I learned Hindi for six months.

1827
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:52,916
(Hindi) But I stopped.

1828
01:53:53,375 --> 01:53:54,875
I stopped learning it, ma'am!

1829
01:53:55,416 --> 01:53:57,000
Not because I couldn't learn Hindi.

1830
01:53:57,625 --> 01:54:00,625
But because nobody has the right
to shove a language down my throat!

1831
01:54:02,916 --> 01:54:05,375
You first told us, "Just learn a few words
and that's enough".

1832
01:54:06,125 --> 01:54:09,416
Now you say we have to speak it as well
as those who've done so all their lives!

1833
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:12,125
They're already at the finish line...

1834
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:15,291
...while we start from the beginning
and we kill ourselves to run this race!

1835
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:18,000
If we don't do that,
we are unemployable.

1836
01:54:18,541 --> 01:54:19,541
You won't hire us!

1837
01:54:19,666 --> 01:54:21,541
Are we not the citizens of this country,
ma'am?

1838
01:54:21,666 --> 01:54:22,666
We are!
-We are!

1839
01:54:22,791 --> 01:54:24,500
Ma'am!
He's a fugitive!

1840
01:54:25,125 --> 01:54:26,250
He has escaped from jail!

1841
01:54:27,041 --> 01:54:28,041
Really?

1842
01:54:29,125 --> 01:54:30,666
Got any record of that?

1843
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:33,000
Do you have any records of my arrest?

1844
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:34,125
An FIR copy?

1845
01:54:35,625 --> 01:54:37,500
All we wrote is "Long Live Hindi"!

1846
01:54:38,375 --> 01:54:39,750
And it must thrive in this city!

1847
01:54:40,916 --> 01:54:42,750
We only ask to let Tamil thrive
in our soil!

1848
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:49,250
(Hindi) Your father gave us his word,
ma'am.

1849
01:54:50,166 --> 01:54:51,500
It's your father's vow.

1850
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:53,875
You need to uphold it, ma'am.

1851
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,291
We want justice!

1852
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:08,125
We want justice!

1853
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:10,666
We want justice!

1854
01:55:10,791 --> 01:55:12,875
We want justice!

1855
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,625
We want justice!

1856
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,625
But you don't seem to care about
the unity of this country.

1857
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,250
In fact just the opposite, ma'am.

1858
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,416
Unity in diversity
is the strength of our nation.

1859
01:55:29,791 --> 01:55:30,875
We want unity.

1860
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,250
You want uniformity.

1861
01:55:32,375 --> 01:55:33,541
That's the difference.

1862
01:55:36,125 --> 01:55:37,125
Ma'am...

1863
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:40,541
I ask for a referendum.
Let people vote for their future.

1864
01:55:42,625 --> 01:55:44,666
But referendums are not constitutional.

1865
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:46,625
Then I ask for a signature campaign!

1866
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:48,000
We'll seek endorsements.

1867
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,875
Please hear the voice of the public.

1868
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,125
As their representative,
take it to the Parliament.

1869
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:55,000
Isn't that constitutional?

1870
01:55:58,166 --> 01:55:59,791
And you said he's an illiterate goon?

1871
01:55:59,916 --> 01:56:00,916
But ma'am...

1872
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:05,750
So what is it you want?

1873
01:56:06,375 --> 01:56:07,500
Firstly, ma'am...

1874
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:09,875
We want English to continue
as the official language.

1875
01:56:10,916 --> 01:56:12,250
But I can't decide that.

1876
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:15,375
You don't have the support
in the Parliament.

1877
01:56:15,791 --> 01:56:19,375
And you definitely don't have
the 75% majority vote...

1878
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,250
...from non-Hindi speaking states.

1879
01:56:22,041 --> 01:56:26,791
What if we prove that we have 75% support
from the students of all non-Hindi states?

1880
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,750
They're the ones who will vote for you.

1881
01:56:33,625 --> 01:56:34,875
And how will you prove that?

1882
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:38,666
The state government says
there's no dissent down south.

1883
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:42,500
But I will prove that we're opposing
this imposition, ma'am.

1884
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:48,375
But I'm assuming that the Tamil people
are not against Hindi.

1885
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:50,375
Absolutely correct, ma'am!
100%!

1886
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:52,625
We are not against Hindi
and we will never be.

1887
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:56,291
We will oppose it only when you impose it
on us, ma'am.

1888
01:56:58,416 --> 01:56:59,416
Okay.

1889
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,500
Show me the support when I come
to Coimbatore on February 12th.

1890
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:05,791
You have seven days.

1891
01:57:05,916 --> 01:57:09,750
How do we show numbers when the state govt.
has imposed Section 144 on us?

1892
01:57:09,875 --> 01:57:10,875
Fair enough!

1893
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:13,291
Section 144 will be revoked.

1894
01:57:13,416 --> 01:57:14,416
Ma'am...

1895
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,625
But here's the thing, Mr. Chezhiyan.

1896
01:57:20,875 --> 01:57:23,500
While I understand your reasons
for today's protest...

1897
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,125
...I do not appreciate
your methods.

1898
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:27,750
It was wrong.

1899
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:30,666
You should not have disturbed the public.

1900
01:57:33,666 --> 01:57:34,666
Sorry, ma'am.

1901
01:57:35,375 --> 01:57:38,041
We have decided to indulge
only in peaceful protests now on.

1902
01:57:39,041 --> 01:57:40,791
Please uphold our trust, ma'am.

1903
01:57:41,541 --> 01:57:42,625
We believe in you, ma'am.

1904
01:57:47,916 --> 01:57:51,625
So according to you, he's not going to be
able to demonstrate the right support, yes?

1905
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:53,500
Not even one percent, ma'am!

1906
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:55,750
Everyone's starving down there!

1907
01:57:55,875 --> 01:58:00,750
Will those people tend to their hunger,
or focus on this silly protest?

1908
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,625
Then why must you worry? You shouldn't.
-Yes, ma'am.

1909
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:05,875
You must understand.

1910
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:10,041
The only way to end this,
is to allow him to do this.

1911
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:14,250
To lose in the eyes of the public
once and for all.

1912
01:58:15,625 --> 01:58:16,625
And if he wins?

1913
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:21,291
We're not bound to accept that decision.
-Yes.

1914
01:58:24,041 --> 01:58:26,416
"A Tamil protest
that brought Delhi to a standstill!"

1915
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:31,000
So far, the voice of protestors
would only echo through Madras State!

1916
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:34,250
It has even reached Delhi now!
-Indeed, sir!

1917
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:36,375
Are you behind this, Mr. Anna?

1918
01:58:36,791 --> 01:58:38,166
No, sir.
We are not behind this.

1919
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,625
But whoever did this
is a brother of mine!

1920
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,125
But whoever has done this
is my brother!

1921
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:47,625
'She, who is like a flowering vine
that smiles like the moon'

1922
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:50,625
'She, who is like a flowering vine
that smiles like the moon'

1923
01:58:53,875 --> 01:58:56,875
'With her honey lips,
she will endow the essence of life'

1924
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,375
'As you savor it drop by drop,
she will bend her head shyly'

1925
01:59:01,666 --> 01:59:05,125
They think we're just young punks
who can't achieve anything!

1926
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:07,291
Let them!

1927
01:59:09,666 --> 01:59:11,000
An army is needed!

1928
01:59:11,125 --> 01:59:12,500
An army is needed!

1929
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:14,291
A great army is needed!

1930
01:59:14,416 --> 01:59:15,875
A great army is needed!

1931
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,875
A great army is needed
to safeguard Tamil!

1932
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,500
'O army of comrades'

1933
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:24,000
'Let's go to war'

1934
01:59:24,125 --> 01:59:26,416
'Be it life or death...'
-Ensure no one finds out.

1935
01:59:26,541 --> 01:59:28,750
'...we shall face it together'

1936
01:59:28,875 --> 01:59:33,625
'With courage,
we will seek answers'

1937
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:37,750
'As a roaring wildfire,
we will reclaim justice'

1938
01:59:38,541 --> 01:59:43,166
'Without seeing the light of change,
these eyes shall sleep not'

1939
01:59:43,291 --> 01:59:47,125
'Even if bullets pierce our chests,
our quest for truth will cease not'

1940
01:59:47,250 --> 01:59:50,500
What crap! What good will come of them?
Look at the trash he's reading!

1941
01:59:50,625 --> 01:59:52,875
'We will guard our motherland
now and forever'

1942
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,166
'We took to arms that day'

1943
01:59:55,291 --> 01:59:57,625
'Even a calf will pounce in an attack'

1944
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:00,125
'A needless, needless law...'
-Steer clear of the cops!

1945
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:02,416
'Won't the arrogance
of those in power fall?'

1946
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:04,625
'Our blood boils to stir us on'

1947
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:06,875
'A war of blazing passion'

1948
02:00:08,625 --> 02:00:09,625
(Telugu) Dear...

1949
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:16,625
Will you kill this old crone, dear?

1950
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:19,041
Without Chinna or Chezhiya,
I don't care who lives or dies!

1951
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,500
(Telugu) Dear...

1952
02:00:20,875 --> 02:00:22,125
That soda guy is here.

1953
02:00:23,125 --> 02:00:24,541
Go.
-A money order from Chezhiyan.

1954
02:00:24,666 --> 02:00:26,875
'Vanquishing oppressors
does not count as sins'

1955
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,250
'Set off like a storm'

1956
02:00:29,291 --> 02:00:30,541
'Set off like a storm'

1957
02:00:31,875 --> 02:00:34,291
'When your wings are torn apart,
stand not with patience'

1958
02:00:34,416 --> 02:00:36,750
'If you rise with fury,
the oppression cannot go on'

1959
02:00:36,875 --> 02:00:38,250
'Be the action'

1960
02:00:39,125 --> 02:00:40,625
'Be the action'

1961
02:00:41,625 --> 02:00:43,875
'If there's evil afoot...'

1962
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,166
'...mustn't it be quelled?'

1963
02:00:46,291 --> 02:00:48,416
'Cowards, we shall never be'

1964
02:00:48,541 --> 02:00:49,875
Chinna was right.

1965
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,541
Comrades of both Gandhiji and Netaji
laid down their lives.

1966
02:00:52,666 --> 02:00:55,875
Another war of independence!
-'A day has a dawn and a dusk'

1967
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,166
'Waging war is the way to victory'

1968
02:00:58,291 --> 02:01:00,666
'Let's get this done,
one way or the other'

1969
02:01:01,125 --> 02:01:03,250
"Mere spectators, this puppet government!"

1970
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,375
"A spineless government."

1971
02:01:05,916 --> 02:01:09,500
"A disgraceful, shameless,
unjust government."

1972
02:01:09,625 --> 02:01:13,625
The opposition is ripping you apart
at the assembly with these words!

1973
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:27,041
'Our war is for the liberation of Tamil'

1974
02:01:27,166 --> 02:01:29,375
'Shatter the obstacles
and leave our foes to dust'

1975
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:30,791
'As mountains,
we shall rise'

1976
02:01:31,666 --> 02:01:33,250
'Reclaim our birthright,
we shall'

1977
02:01:34,416 --> 02:01:36,625
'Let the feeling
that Tamil is our life soar'

1978
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,875
'Even if the end approaches...'

1979
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,125
'...let's fight injustice'

1980
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:43,875
'As a fire, let's blaze...
We shall never hesitate to rage'

1981
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,750
'The culture that taught justice
to the custodians of justice...'

1982
02:01:48,875 --> 02:01:52,250
'How can we accept the orders
of the oppressors?'

1983
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:58,250
'The culture known for its compassion
even to a jasmine vine...'

1984
02:01:58,375 --> 02:02:01,250
'How can we accept trouble
and be ruined?'

1985
02:02:01,375 --> 02:02:03,125
'Let's get this done,
one way or the other'

1986
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:05,416
'O army of comrades'

1987
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:07,416
'Let's go to war'

1988
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,250
'Be it life or death...'

1989
02:02:10,375 --> 02:02:12,125
'...we shall face it together'

1990
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:16,791
'With courage,
we will seek answers'

1991
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:21,791
'As a roaring wildfire,
we will reclaim justice'

1992
02:02:25,166 --> 02:02:26,166
May I sit, sir?

1993
02:02:26,916 --> 02:02:27,916
Sit the hell down!

1994
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:29,666
As if you have manners!

1995
02:02:30,125 --> 02:02:32,875
I had flagged all post offices
in Delhi.

1996
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,250
After the protest...

1997
02:02:34,375 --> 02:02:36,791
...22 money orders were sent,
all for the same amount!

1998
02:02:38,291 --> 02:02:39,291
So?

1999
02:02:39,416 --> 02:02:40,416
12.02 rupees.

2000
02:02:41,125 --> 02:02:43,625
Twelfth day, second month.
February 12.

2001
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,625
What?

2002
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:49,875
All along, they've used a sum to represent
the day of their operation.

2003
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,291
The day of their operation.

2004
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:53,000
Turn it around and take a look.

2005
02:02:56,791 --> 02:03:00,250
"We'll meet in Pollachi.
Through Aaliyar forest from Valparai."

2006
02:03:01,625 --> 02:03:02,625
"Gandhi."

2007
02:03:05,125 --> 02:03:06,375
What language script is this?

2008
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,750
Brahmi. 2,000 years old.

2009
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:11,250
How do you know?

2010
02:03:11,375 --> 02:03:14,375
In the last six years, I learned
every iteration of the Tamil script.

2011
02:03:15,916 --> 02:03:18,166
I let these money orders go through.

2012
02:03:19,125 --> 02:03:20,916
Shall I say why, Mr. Chief Minister?

2013
02:03:21,416 --> 02:03:22,541
It says 'Gandhi'.

2014
02:03:22,666 --> 02:03:24,875
It definitely must be the Gandhi Memorial
in Madurai.

2015
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,625
You know what happened there
and who showed up.

2016
02:03:28,166 --> 02:03:32,166
The entire Puranaanooru gang who burned
down a train are coming to Pollachi.

2017
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:37,125
Just one of them
brought Delhi to its knees!

2018
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:39,000
Don't worry, sir.

2019
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,916
Not a single signature will reach Delhi.

2020
02:03:41,041 --> 02:03:43,375
Because not a single one of them
will reach Coimbatore.

2021
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:45,375
I need your orders.

2022
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:47,375
But...

2023
02:03:48,416 --> 02:03:51,000
Isn't the state police
entirely at your command?

2024
02:03:52,125 --> 02:03:53,625
I don't need state police.

2025
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:54,750
Why?

2026
02:03:54,875 --> 02:03:56,125
Look at their names!

2027
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:58,916
Tamilkumaran, Tamilarasan, Tamilvendan...
Tamil everywhere!

2028
02:03:59,041 --> 02:04:00,375
I can't do shit with them!

2029
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,750
I want a special task force.

2030
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:07,291
My requisition.

2031
02:04:07,416 --> 02:04:11,750
Non-Tamil speaking police and personnel
from other states.

2032
02:04:11,875 --> 02:04:12,875
Immediately.

2033
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:14,541
There won't be any media.

2034
02:04:16,125 --> 02:04:18,541
We'll wipe them out
and bury them in Pollachi.

2035
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:20,416
The public will never know.

2036
02:04:21,125 --> 02:04:22,875
Come! Park here!

2037
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,500
No problems on the way, Vaigarai?
-No.

2038
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,625
Haven't seen you all in six years!
-Brother!

2039
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:30,791
I've had our boys stashed away
all across Pollachi!

2040
02:04:30,916 --> 02:04:32,541
Don't worry.
We'll take care of them.

2041
02:04:32,666 --> 02:04:34,125
Signatures arrive safely?

2042
02:04:35,416 --> 02:04:37,250
Where are the kids from the other states?

2043
02:04:37,375 --> 02:04:38,750
Michael, Chacko and the rest?

2044
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:40,875
Just our state, huh?

2045
02:04:42,125 --> 02:04:44,000
We need them to get the majority, right?

2046
02:04:44,125 --> 02:04:46,666
We'll have to make do
with those who are here by dawn.

2047
02:04:48,375 --> 02:04:50,750
Been years since you all tasted this soda!
Open one up!

2048
02:04:51,916 --> 02:04:53,875
Park these vans in the grove, Palanisamy!

2049
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Let's go! Come on!

2050
02:04:55,125 --> 02:04:56,625
Not a single van should be seen here!

2051
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:58,000
Come along, Poovai!

2052
02:04:58,125 --> 02:04:59,541
I'll go to my Grandma's tonight.

2053
02:04:59,666 --> 02:05:01,416
I'll bring the guys over before dawn!

2054
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,250
Be safe.
-Will do!

2055
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,250
Hold this!

2056
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,125
Sir!

2057
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:19,791
No chance a single student
has crossed this check post.

2058
02:05:28,375 --> 02:05:29,375
It's time, Chezhiya.

2059
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,916
I don't think those guys are coming.

2060
02:05:32,666 --> 02:05:33,666
Chezhiya!

2061
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,041
I have an idea!

2062
02:05:36,166 --> 02:05:38,791
There's something called pirate radio.
We can talk on that!

2063
02:05:38,916 --> 02:05:41,000
We can tell the world
what's happening here.

2064
02:05:41,125 --> 02:05:42,416
At Dhanushkodi last year...

2065
02:05:42,541 --> 02:05:45,125
Enough! Stick to just screwing around
electric wires!

2066
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:48,041
Like you're Sarojini Naidu
who can sing like a bird on the mic!

2067
02:05:48,166 --> 02:05:50,625
And she claims she can save Tamil!

2068
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:54,375
She fancies she can save it all
with radio parts she stole!

2069
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,041
Listen!

2070
02:05:56,166 --> 02:05:57,625
I was born and raised here!

2071
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:00,250
I'm just as much Tamil as you are!

2072
02:06:01,041 --> 02:06:02,166
Understand this!

2073
02:06:02,791 --> 02:06:06,791
If Telugu is named the national language,
I will be the first to protest against it!

2074
02:06:14,375 --> 02:06:15,750
"How can I talk in the radio?"

2075
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:18,166
"You already know the answer, Ratna."

2076
02:06:18,291 --> 02:06:21,500
"This government has every radio station
and newspaper in its pocket!"

2077
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:24,750
"They decide what news
the public gets to hear and read!"

2078
02:06:25,375 --> 02:06:26,416
"We need to shatter that."

2079
02:06:27,375 --> 02:06:29,416
"Are radio waves their birthright?"

2080
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,125
"They can hear it even if we talk, right?"

2081
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:33,625
"Speak, Ratna!"

2082
02:06:34,416 --> 02:06:35,750
"We'll see what they do!"

2083
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,625
From a certain height
and a certain angle...

2084
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:45,541
...we can broadcast
across long distances.

2085
02:06:46,791 --> 02:06:50,291
We can even hack into the frequency
of National Radio!

2086
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,125
Signal intrusion.

2087
02:06:54,625 --> 02:06:56,250
I learned it from the enemy, Mister.

2088
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:58,500
Highly risky.

2089
02:06:59,375 --> 02:07:00,500
But it's doable!

2090
02:07:01,125 --> 02:07:03,750
We should use it to tell the world
what's happening here!

2091
02:07:07,291 --> 02:07:09,375
(Telugu) Who the hell are you
to question me?

2092
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:12,000
(Telugu) You can't speak two languages
even to save your life!

2093
02:07:12,125 --> 02:07:14,166
(Telugu) I'll rip your tongue out, jackass!

2094
02:07:14,291 --> 02:07:16,125
(Telugu) Brainless oaf!

2095
02:07:16,916 --> 02:07:19,125
(Telugu) Who the hell are you
to question me?

2096
02:07:20,875 --> 02:07:23,916
Hey... She's saying something in Telugu.

2097
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:25,500
I don't follow!

2098
02:07:26,625 --> 02:07:28,500
She can cuss in all languages!

2099
02:07:39,541 --> 02:07:40,541
Michael Reddy!

2100
02:07:47,625 --> 02:07:48,625
Shariffa!

2101
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:50,541
Welcome!

2102
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,250
Chezhiya!

2103
02:07:52,375 --> 02:07:53,916
Welcome!

2104
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:55,750
Chezhiya!
-How are you, Singh?

2105
02:07:55,875 --> 02:07:56,875
I'm good. How about you?

2106
02:07:58,375 --> 02:07:59,875
When I saw the codeword 'Gandhi'...

2107
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:02,916
...I knew I had to come here
even if it costs me my life!

2108
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:05,416
The first money order in six years!
How could I not come?

2109
02:08:05,541 --> 02:08:07,541
How'd you get past the cops?

2110
02:08:07,666 --> 02:08:10,250
We parked at Udumalaipettai
and took the freight train!

2111
02:08:10,375 --> 02:08:12,666
That's how we get the goods
for our mill!

2112
02:08:13,291 --> 02:08:15,750
Chacko couldn't make it, Che.

2113
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:19,250
He was summoned
for a government operation.

2114
02:08:19,375 --> 02:08:21,000
Only Kerala signatures aren't here yet?

2115
02:08:21,125 --> 02:08:22,750
Come, let's go eat!
-Brother!

2116
02:08:23,916 --> 02:08:25,041
It's okay. We'll handle it.

2117
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:28,250
You guys have come from all over
the nation to save a mother tongue!

2118
02:08:28,375 --> 02:08:30,375
What kind of man would I be
if I didn't feed our kin?

2119
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:33,750
Come along, everyone!

2120
02:08:35,791 --> 02:08:37,291
Eat as much as you want!

2121
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:40,041
(Telugu) Eat well!

2122
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:43,000
Serve some to the Bengali girl!
-(Kannada) Chow down!

2123
02:08:43,666 --> 02:08:47,125
(Bengali) Eating on banana leaves
seems to be a staple of Tamil culture.

2124
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:48,625
(Bengali) Great food, right?

2125
02:08:49,416 --> 02:08:50,750
(Telugu) Damn! So spicy!

2126
02:08:51,625 --> 02:08:53,916
Come to Madurai
and we'll gorge down spiny loach soup!

2127
02:08:55,041 --> 02:08:56,500
No food like Madurai food!

2128
02:08:57,166 --> 02:09:00,041
(Kannada) Come over to my place!
You won't see food like ours anywhere!

2129
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:04,541
This is our India right here!

2130
02:09:04,666 --> 02:09:07,916
Banana leaves loaded with stew,
vegetables, lentil curry, tamarind stew...

2131
02:09:08,041 --> 02:09:09,375
Like a feast!

2132
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:11,375
But what does this damn government say?

2133
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:13,875
They're trying to turn India
into a land without diversity!

2134
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
The dumbos!

2135
02:09:15,125 --> 02:09:17,125
(Telugu) Hit the nail in the head!
-Spot on!

2136
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:19,750
Eat well!

2137
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:23,750
Relax. We'll mop the floor with them!

2138
02:09:23,875 --> 02:09:25,250
(Kannada) Well said!

2139
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:31,625
Leave in half an hour.

2140
02:09:42,166 --> 02:09:44,375
Attention, citizens!

2141
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:48,125
Turn in the students who are hiding
in your town immediately!

2142
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,875
I have shooting orders!

2143
02:09:52,541 --> 02:09:54,666
Why must you die for those miscreants?

2144
02:09:55,916 --> 02:09:57,791
How did this mongrel pick up our scent?

2145
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:00,875
He read my tattoo.

2146
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,375
He saw the money orders.

2147
02:10:05,625 --> 02:10:06,625
He understands Brahmi!

2148
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:08,666
How did this slip past me?

2149
02:10:09,625 --> 02:10:10,625
But...

2150
02:10:11,125 --> 02:10:13,916
But why did he let money orders through
and get us here?

2151
02:10:18,541 --> 02:10:19,750
Brother Thambi?

2152
02:10:19,875 --> 02:10:22,000
Is there another way in to Coimbatore?

2153
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:24,500
No, there isn't.

2154
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,500
There is a way. But...

2155
02:10:33,791 --> 02:10:34,791
Sir!

2156
02:10:35,625 --> 02:10:36,625
Forces are here, sir.

2157
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:38,916
(Malayalam) It's all quiet.
There's no issue here!

2158
02:10:39,041 --> 02:10:40,125
Hey!

2159
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:42,000
We already told you there's nobody here!

2160
02:10:42,125 --> 02:10:43,125
Leave!

2161
02:10:45,625 --> 02:10:46,625
Get going!

2162
02:10:47,625 --> 02:10:49,291
Please leave!

2163
02:10:51,125 --> 02:10:52,750
(Malayalam) There seems to be no issue.

2164
02:10:52,875 --> 02:10:54,166
Then create one!

2165
02:10:59,625 --> 02:11:02,000
This is how the factory's sewage
reaches the Aliyar river.

2166
02:11:02,125 --> 02:11:04,375
You can use it to get to the outskirts
of town!

2167
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,000
Easy to reach the main road from there!

2168
02:11:07,625 --> 02:11:09,291
Sir...
-(Malayalam) Search that side!

2169
02:11:09,416 --> 02:11:10,625
What's going on, sir?

2170
02:11:11,166 --> 02:11:12,875
(Malayalam) We got one!
-Let go of me.

2171
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,375
(Malayalam) Come!
-Let go of him!

2172
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:15,500
Let go!

2173
02:11:15,625 --> 02:11:18,625
Please spare my grandson!
-(Malayalam) Don't let him escape!

2174
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:19,875
Let go!

2175
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,541
Why are you arresting me?

2176
02:11:21,666 --> 02:11:23,000
Let go of my hand!

2177
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:24,625
Let go!
-(Malayalam) I'll whack you!

2178
02:11:28,166 --> 02:11:29,791
Please let him go, sir.
He's innocent!

2179
02:11:39,375 --> 02:11:41,291
This is the reason for the trouble, right?
Watch!

2180
02:11:43,875 --> 02:11:45,625
Careful!
-Come quickly!

2181
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:47,750
One at a time!
-Hurry!

2182
02:11:47,875 --> 02:11:49,000
Watch your step, dear!

2183
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:50,500
(Hindi) Careful, Ratna!
-Be safe!

2184
02:11:50,916 --> 02:11:52,666
He smeared dung on the post office board.

2185
02:11:53,541 --> 02:11:55,291
Is it still quiet, Commander?

2186
02:11:59,291 --> 02:12:02,416
They killed him! Is there no one
to question this injustice?

2187
02:12:04,375 --> 02:12:05,750
My dear boy!

2188
02:12:11,416 --> 02:12:13,500
Forces!
Lathi charge!

2189
02:12:13,625 --> 02:12:16,000
Come on!
Charge!

2190
02:12:32,125 --> 02:12:33,416
I'm not leaving you behind.

2191
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:37,416
If our last stand is deemed to be
in Pollachi, so be it!

2192
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,500
What's the point if we all perish here?

2193
02:12:41,125 --> 02:12:43,375
Our army and these signatures
need to reach Coimbatore!

2194
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:45,666
Gather everyone and leave!
I'll come with the van!

2195
02:12:57,250 --> 02:12:58,250
Leave them alone!

2196
02:12:58,375 --> 02:12:59,875
You killed my grandson!

2197
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:04,750
The mob is attacking us, sir!

2198
02:13:04,875 --> 02:13:06,750
We're suffering casualties!
We need backup!

2199
02:13:07,666 --> 02:13:08,666
You may leave.

2200
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:27,625
I'll have the vans drop off the goods.

2201
02:13:28,625 --> 02:13:29,750
Travel safe!

2202
02:13:31,125 --> 02:13:32,500
Victory and courage to us all!

2203
02:15:00,375 --> 02:15:01,625
Won't answer me, huh?

2204
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:04,625
Just turn in the students
and the signatures.

2205
02:15:09,291 --> 02:15:11,000
Rifle Company!
Open fire!

2206
02:15:15,625 --> 02:15:21,166
These mongrels have decided
to turn Pollachi into a cemetery?

2207
02:15:26,875 --> 02:15:28,375
Hey! Come on!

2208
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:29,541
Come along, Ratna!

2209
02:15:29,666 --> 02:15:31,875
I have an important errand to run.
Be right back.

2210
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,791
Go on.
-Are you insane?

2211
02:15:33,916 --> 02:15:35,875
They're shooting us down
without any restraint!

2212
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Come along, I say!

2213
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Go on.

2214
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:44,500
Be safe.

2215
02:15:46,125 --> 02:15:47,916
Let's go!
Come on!

2216
02:15:58,291 --> 02:15:59,625
I have a child, sir!

2217
02:16:00,250 --> 02:16:02,375
Please tell them not to fire, sir!

2218
02:16:21,791 --> 02:16:23,125
We caught the students, sir.

2219
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:45,000
Answer my question
only with the truth.

2220
02:16:46,166 --> 02:16:47,416
Where is Chezhiyan?

2221
02:16:48,375 --> 02:16:49,375
Sir!

2222
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:52,750
Found the signed papers?
-No, sir.

2223
02:16:59,875 --> 02:17:01,500
One by one, all of you will die!

2224
02:17:02,125 --> 02:17:04,250
Tell me!
Where is Chezhiyan?

2225
02:17:05,125 --> 02:17:06,125
I don't know, sir.

2226
02:17:09,375 --> 02:17:12,125
If you couldn't find the papers,
it doesn't mean they're not here!

2227
02:17:12,875 --> 02:17:14,125
Go search!
-Yes, sir!

2228
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,750
Every single one of you are suspects!

2229
02:17:19,375 --> 02:17:21,750
You! You! You!
All of you are suspects!

2230
02:17:21,875 --> 02:17:24,125
If I toss you in jail,
you'll be there for life!

2231
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:26,125
Please, sir... No...
-Where is Chezhiyan?

2232
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:27,416
Where the hell is he?

2233
02:17:27,541 --> 02:17:29,166
I swear I don't know!

2234
02:17:31,125 --> 02:17:32,125
Sir!

2235
02:17:32,250 --> 02:17:33,625
Why are you doing this to us?

2236
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:22,250
You found your target.

2237
02:18:23,625 --> 02:18:24,625
Let these people go.

2238
02:18:26,041 --> 02:18:27,041
Sir!

2239
02:18:27,166 --> 02:18:28,500
All the signatures are in there!

2240
02:18:30,541 --> 02:18:31,666
Burn them.

2241
02:18:31,791 --> 02:18:32,875
Burn them all.

2242
02:19:00,625 --> 02:19:02,000
Where the hell are the papers?

2243
02:19:02,125 --> 02:19:03,375
Tricking me with empty sheets?

2244
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,125
You took your own sweet time, Major!
You're late!

2245
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,416
Shoot all of them
and burn them all!

2246
02:19:21,041 --> 02:19:23,125
There must be no evidence
of this entire incident!

2247
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:24,875
History should have no record of this!

2248
02:19:27,375 --> 02:19:28,541
Major!

2249
02:19:29,125 --> 02:19:30,500
Don't shoot him!
I need him!

2250
02:19:36,625 --> 02:19:37,625
Brother Thambi!

2251
02:19:38,291 --> 02:19:39,875
Do you know to drive this thing
or not?

2252
02:19:40,375 --> 02:19:41,666
My first time, buddy!

2253
02:19:41,791 --> 02:19:43,166
The drivers usually handle this!

2254
02:19:44,125 --> 02:19:45,250
Don't be scared!

2255
02:19:45,375 --> 02:19:47,250
Just watch how we reach our destination!

2256
02:19:47,375 --> 02:19:48,500
Where?
-Where, brother?

2257
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:51,000
Where are we going?
-"Where are we going"?

2258
02:19:51,375 --> 02:19:53,291
Where else? Coimbatore!
-Seems unlikely!

2259
02:20:09,666 --> 02:20:10,666
Police!

2260
02:20:11,375 --> 02:20:14,666
Come what may, that lady doesn't leave
without seeing the signatures!

2261
02:20:14,791 --> 02:20:16,000
I'll handle the cops.

2262
02:20:16,125 --> 02:20:17,500
(Telugu) Be careful, Shariffa.

2263
02:20:17,625 --> 02:20:19,250
(Telugu) Take care.
-(Kannada) I will.

2264
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,250
Careful, Michael!

2265
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:26,750
(Kannada) Be alert,
Michael Reddy!

2266
02:20:31,541 --> 02:20:33,500
(Malayalam) One of them is getting away!
Get him!

2267
02:20:55,125 --> 02:20:57,750
(Kannada) Don't stop, brother!
Keep going!

2268
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:07,500
Michael!

2269
02:21:41,875 --> 02:21:42,875
Come in, Gauri!

2270
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:46,875
The minister's life is in danger!

2271
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,916
Get her out of the Coimbatore station
immediately!

2272
02:21:50,625 --> 02:21:51,625
I can't hear you, sir.

2273
02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:52,750
Come in, Gauri!

2274
02:21:53,875 --> 02:21:56,500
The minister's life is in jeopardy!
Get her out of the station!

2275
02:22:03,166 --> 02:22:04,750
Hoist it that side!
Can't get a signal!

2276
02:22:14,250 --> 02:22:15,375
Got it!
-Got it?

2277
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:16,500
Yes!

2278
02:22:21,875 --> 02:22:23,750
For a human to think...

2279
02:22:24,375 --> 02:22:25,666
...the most impor...

2280
02:22:25,791 --> 02:22:28,916
...important tool...

2281
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:31,791
...is... is...

2282
02:22:31,916 --> 02:22:32,916
...language!

2283
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:53,250
Destroying a language
is akin to destroying one's identity.

2284
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:56,666
An individual without an identity
can easily be enslaved.

2285
02:22:57,750 --> 02:22:59,250
Language politics in a nutshell!

2286
02:23:00,916 --> 02:23:04,541
Destroying my mother tongue is akin
to destroying my ability to think.

2287
02:23:06,125 --> 02:23:09,041
If we are unable to think,
how can we ever make progress?

2288
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:12,750
That's what they want.

2289
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:18,875
To show your support for Tamil,
assemble at the Coimbatore Junction!

2290
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Go for field radio officer, 13th Company,
over!

2291
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:31,166
Special Officer Thiru here!
Over!

2292
02:23:31,291 --> 02:23:33,041
Reading loud and clear!
I await your order!

2293
02:23:33,166 --> 02:23:36,666
They've planted bombs on a freight train
heading from Podanur to Coimbatore!

2294
02:23:36,791 --> 02:23:39,375
Target is the I&amp;B minister!
It'll explode on arrival!

2295
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:42,250
Contact the station master now
and have him stop the train!

2296
02:23:42,375 --> 02:23:43,375
Roger that, sir!

2297
02:23:44,041 --> 02:23:45,166
Where are the students?

2298
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:47,750
They just talk tough, ma'am.

2299
02:23:49,250 --> 02:23:51,875
Give them a mic,
and they'll ramble for hours!

2300
02:23:53,875 --> 02:23:56,291
You can get going.
Why needlessly waste your time?

2301
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:58,875
Sir?
-Have an escort ready for Ma'am.

2302
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Chief...
-Yes, sir.

2303
02:24:02,875 --> 02:24:03,875
My resignation.

2304
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:06,750
What the hell, man?

2305
02:24:06,875 --> 02:24:08,125
No sense of timing!

2306
02:24:09,125 --> 02:24:10,291
Not the time for all this!

2307
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:12,000
What is the problem, Mr. Rao?

2308
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:13,500
Ma'am...

2309
02:24:13,625 --> 02:24:15,041
There's still two hours left.

2310
02:24:15,625 --> 02:24:17,375
You've given your word.
Please uphold it.

2311
02:24:35,666 --> 02:24:36,750
Why didn't the train stop?

2312
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:38,250
Come in, RTO!

2313
02:24:38,875 --> 02:24:39,875
What the hell!

2314
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Soldiers!

2315
02:24:44,291 --> 02:24:46,416
'Fire up your intellect
and make your foes tremble'

2316
02:24:46,541 --> 02:24:47,541
(Malayalam) Hurry!

2317
02:24:47,666 --> 02:24:50,125
'Sharpen your core
and erupt like a volcano'

2318
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:52,125
'Ours is a great army'

2319
02:24:52,875 --> 02:24:55,000
'Bear witness, for ours is a great army'

2320
02:24:56,625 --> 02:24:57,875
You are late, Major!

2321
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
(Malayalam) You told me to be late!

2322
02:25:00,125 --> 02:25:01,375
(Malayalam) Didn't I tell you?

2323
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:03,875
That you'd salute me one day?

2324
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,791
You'll salute this Major one day!

2325
02:25:07,125 --> 02:25:08,125
Go ahead!

2326
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:12,500
Arms down!

2327
02:25:13,125 --> 02:25:14,125
Operation over!

2328
02:25:14,916 --> 02:25:17,791
From this moment,
we commence a rescue operation!

2329
02:25:17,916 --> 02:25:18,916
Dismissed!

2330
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:27,125
Two hours are up, Mr. Rao.

2331
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:28,750
I must leave.

2332
02:25:29,166 --> 02:25:30,500
Namaste.
-Namaste, ma'am.

2333
02:25:48,166 --> 02:25:51,916
Long Live Hindi!

2334
02:25:52,041 --> 02:25:54,625
Long Live Hindi!

2335
02:26:25,541 --> 02:26:27,125
I'll give the red signal.
Okay, sir.

2336
02:26:28,125 --> 02:26:32,000
No matter what, Ma'am does not leave
this station without hearing our voice.

2337
02:26:32,125 --> 02:26:33,250
Yes, Shariffa!

2338
02:26:33,375 --> 02:26:34,666
Take care, Brother Thambi.

2339
02:26:34,791 --> 02:26:36,125
I got this. Go on!

2340
02:26:51,666 --> 02:26:52,875
You can sit here, ma'am.

2341
02:26:57,250 --> 02:26:58,875
The train will be here soon, ma'am.

2342
02:27:17,375 --> 02:27:18,541
Why isn't the train here yet?

2343
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:20,500
What is the problem?

2344
02:27:20,625 --> 02:27:21,875
It'll be here any moment.

2345
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,000
What the hell, man?

2346
02:28:24,875 --> 02:28:28,125
Know what happens when you try
to restrain combustive material?

2347
02:28:29,916 --> 02:28:30,916
Blowback!

2348
02:28:33,375 --> 02:28:34,375
Very well.

2349
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Let's die together!

2350
02:28:37,125 --> 02:28:39,166
Let those signatures go up in smoke
with us!

2351
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:03,791
No matter what you do
or however long you take...

2352
02:29:03,916 --> 02:29:05,375
...we'll just keep coming!

2353
02:29:05,791 --> 02:29:06,791
Bring it on!

2354
02:29:06,916 --> 02:29:08,875
Our grandchildren will be ready for you!

2355
02:30:16,666 --> 02:30:17,666
Charge!

2356
02:30:17,791 --> 02:30:19,125
Come on!

2357
02:30:19,250 --> 02:30:20,666
What are you doing?
Restrain them!

2358
02:30:20,791 --> 02:30:22,750
Restrain them!
-Come on!

2359
02:30:22,875 --> 02:30:24,375
Come on!
-Hurry!

2360
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:26,791
Get it all out!
-Hurry!

2361
02:30:26,916 --> 02:30:28,875
This way!
-Ma'am!

2362
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,250
Please, ma'am!

2363
02:30:30,375 --> 02:30:31,375
Ma'am!

2364
02:30:34,416 --> 02:30:36,625
(Kannada) Signatures from the land
of Basavanna!

2365
02:30:36,750 --> 02:30:38,416
Signatures from the land
of Basavanna!

2366
02:30:38,541 --> 02:30:39,875
The Father of Democracy!

2367
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,666
Bangalore, Gulbarga, Hubli, Davangere,
Tumkur, Chikmanglur, Mangalore, Mysore!

2368
02:30:43,791 --> 02:30:46,500
(Karnataka) The entire Mysore State!
-The whole of Mysore!

2369
02:30:46,625 --> 02:30:48,125
Get it? All of Mysore, it seems!

2370
02:30:49,250 --> 02:30:50,250
Pull it up!

2371
02:30:51,250 --> 02:30:52,625
Does this script look the same?

2372
02:30:58,500 --> 02:30:59,500
Yes.

2373
02:31:00,791 --> 02:31:02,000
It looks all the same to me.

2374
02:31:02,125 --> 02:31:03,500
This is a very different language.

2375
02:31:03,625 --> 02:31:05,875
These are from my neighboring state.
Andhra Pradesh.

2376
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Telugu, ma'am! Telugu!
-Yes, ma'am!

2377
02:31:08,125 --> 02:31:10,750
Yes, ma'am. They look alike,
but they're different languages!

2378
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:15,000
(Bengali) This is Bengali, ma'am!

2379
02:31:16,125 --> 02:31:20,916
(Bengali) 'Even if no one
rallies behind you, walk on alone'

2380
02:31:21,541 --> 02:31:25,000
(Bengali) 'Walk on alone'

2381
02:31:25,750 --> 02:31:27,500
But we are not alone here, ma'am!

2382
02:31:28,875 --> 02:31:30,291
All the languages are here!

2383
02:31:31,125 --> 02:31:33,875
All the languages!
All the languages!

2384
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:36,250
(Malayalam) I'm Malayali, ma'am.

2385
02:31:36,375 --> 02:31:38,166
(Malayalam) These are from Kerala.

2386
02:31:38,291 --> 02:31:40,916
Malayalam! Malayalam! Malayalam!

2387
02:31:41,625 --> 02:31:43,875
This letter came from Madras,
ma'am.

2388
02:31:45,416 --> 02:31:46,666
First daughter's mark sheet.

2389
02:31:47,625 --> 02:31:49,125
Younger daughter's name?

2390
02:31:49,250 --> 02:31:50,250
Named after you!

2391
02:31:50,916 --> 02:31:51,916
Yes, ma'am.

2392
02:31:52,416 --> 02:31:54,375
Two daughters futures in your hands,
ma'am.

2393
02:32:03,666 --> 02:32:04,916
Sir!

2394
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:06,750
Let's get you to the hospital!

2395
02:32:11,916 --> 02:32:13,000
Let's go to the hospital!

2396
02:32:13,125 --> 02:32:14,125
Why?

2397
02:32:15,250 --> 02:32:17,416
You expect to get
an award for Best Nurse?

2398
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:24,166
No mongrel will dare question my loyalty.

2399
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:32,500
Is this Hindi?
Can you please read and tell?

2400
02:32:33,875 --> 02:32:34,875
This is Marathi.

2401
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,500
Marathi! Marathi! Marathi!

2402
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Tamil!

2403
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:44,750
Chezhiya!

2404
02:32:46,750 --> 02:32:48,000
Tamil, ma'am...

2405
02:32:49,541 --> 02:32:51,000
Help him up!
-Chezhiya!

2406
02:32:51,125 --> 02:32:52,375
Get him up!

2407
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:53,666
Ma'am!

2408
02:32:53,791 --> 02:32:55,875
It was wrong of us to even ask them
for signatures!

2409
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:00,000
What can illiterate citizens do?

2410
02:33:01,250 --> 02:33:02,291
To show their support...

2411
02:33:03,291 --> 02:33:04,750
...they sent their ration cards.

2412
02:33:09,375 --> 02:33:10,875
(Hindi) Their means of sustenance.

2413
02:33:11,375 --> 02:33:12,541
That's what they sent over.

2414
02:33:15,791 --> 02:33:18,250
What more evidence do you need
for public support?

2415
02:33:20,750 --> 02:33:22,666
Do we have to bring over the people
who sent these?

2416
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:27,875
Your people blocked every path
on their journey.

2417
02:33:29,375 --> 02:33:30,666
The ones who surpassed it?

2418
02:33:31,875 --> 02:33:33,000
They were shot to death.

2419
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:39,000
"As hard as it'd be for North Indians,
if Tamil is legally forced on them..."

2420
02:33:39,125 --> 02:33:41,125
"...that's how it's like
for us to learn Hindi."

2421
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,875
Lullabies of our mothers,
stories of our grandmothers...

2422
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,625
'Wisdom of our grandfathers..."

2423
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:48,875
"Our education, literature, music..."

2424
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,125
"All of it is etched in our blood!"

2425
02:33:51,875 --> 02:33:55,625
As you can't take the language out
of our blood, you intend to make us bleed?

2426
02:33:57,750 --> 02:34:01,875
"To show your support for Tamil,
assemble at the Coimbatore Junction!"

2427
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,500
"The futures of the students
are in your hands!"

2428
02:34:04,625 --> 02:34:06,375
"Your future is in your hands!"

2429
02:34:08,250 --> 02:34:10,041
As of now,
we'll stop this protest.

2430
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
We've done everything we could.

2431
02:34:18,166 --> 02:34:20,000
What do you intend to do, ma'am?

2432
02:34:22,375 --> 02:34:24,750
He says he's done what he could do.
It's up to you now.

2433
02:34:32,166 --> 02:34:33,666
"Our bodies may fall."

2434
02:34:34,166 --> 02:34:35,791
"But our linguistic pride never will!"

2435
02:34:35,916 --> 02:34:37,375
"Our voices will not abate!"

2436
02:34:37,791 --> 02:34:40,166
Until the last Tamilian is left,
it will echo far and wide!

2437
02:34:40,625 --> 02:34:43,375
"Our bodies, for this soil.
Our lives, for Tamil!"

2438
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:44,541
Long Live Tamil!

2439
02:34:45,791 --> 02:34:46,791
Victory to Tamilians!

2440
02:34:46,916 --> 02:34:48,291
"Victory to Tamilians!"

2441
02:34:56,125 --> 02:34:59,041
"I give my word to the students
of this nation!"

2442
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:02,250
The promises of our late great
Prime Minister...

2443
02:35:03,250 --> 02:35:07,000
...will continue to be upheld
wholeheartedly!

2444
02:35:07,125 --> 02:35:10,541
"Every state is free to choose
their own official language."

2445
02:35:10,666 --> 02:35:15,375
"Be it through their regional language
or English..."

2446
02:35:16,291 --> 02:35:19,916
"...they have complete freedom
to conduct their official business!"

2447
02:35:20,750 --> 02:35:23,750
"If even one non-Hindi speaking
state..."

2448
02:35:23,875 --> 02:35:28,666
"...voices its displeasure against
making Hindi the sole official language..."

2449
02:35:29,375 --> 02:35:31,250
"...the bill will not be passed."

2450
02:35:31,916 --> 02:35:38,041
"I firmly state that English will continue
to be recognized as an official language!"

2451
02:35:41,291 --> 02:35:45,375
Should the legislative assembly be convened
hastily because the students ask so?

2452
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:46,625
Who are students?

2453
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,250
The blood of our blood.

2454
02:35:48,375 --> 02:35:49,750
The flesh of our flesh.

2455
02:35:49,875 --> 02:35:51,125
The soul of our future!

2456
02:35:53,625 --> 02:35:55,166
What about the train they burned down?

2457
02:35:56,166 --> 02:35:58,875
A few burnt train coaches
can be rebuilt.

2458
02:35:59,791 --> 02:36:02,625
But if the lives of students
are destroyed...

2459
02:36:02,750 --> 02:36:04,125
...can it be reclaimed?

2460
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:11,750
"We disregard the Official Languages Act
in all schools of Tamil Nadu."

2461
02:36:12,291 --> 02:36:17,791
"This assembly decrees Tamil and English
to be the official mediums of instruction."

2462
02:36:24,041 --> 02:36:25,375
Long Live Tamil!

2463
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:27,750
Long Live Tamil!

2464
02:36:31,625 --> 02:36:33,125
Long Live Tamil!

2465
02:36:52,375 --> 02:36:55,875
"A statue immortalizing comrade Rajendran,
who succumbed to police gunfire..."

2466
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,125
"...has been erected at the entrance
of his alma mater."

2467
02:37:48,916 --> 02:37:51,375
'O army of comrades'

2468
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:53,750
'Let's go to war'

2469
02:37:53,875 --> 02:37:56,166
'Be it life or death...'

2470
02:37:56,291 --> 02:37:58,500
'...we shall face it together'

2471
02:37:58,625 --> 02:38:03,375
'With courage,
we will seek answers'

2472
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:07,500
'As a roaring wildfire,
we will reclaim justice'

2473
02:38:08,291 --> 02:38:12,916
'Without seeing the light of change,
these eyes shall sleep not'

2474
02:38:13,041 --> 02:38:17,625
'Even if bullets pierce our chests,
our quest for truth will cease not'

2475
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:20,250
'No change comes about on its own'

2476
02:38:20,375 --> 02:38:22,625
'We will guard our motherland
now and forever'

2477
02:38:22,750 --> 02:38:24,916
'We took to arms that day'

2478
02:38:25,041 --> 02:38:27,375
'Even a calf will pounce in an attack'

2479
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:29,875
'A needless, needless law...'

2480
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,166
'Won't the arrogance
of those in power fall?'

2481
02:38:32,291 --> 02:38:34,375
'Our blood boils to stir us on'

2482
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:36,625
'A war of blazing passion'

2483
02:38:39,166 --> 02:38:41,416
'How is it right to relinquish
what belongs to us?'

2484
02:38:41,541 --> 02:38:43,875
'Vanquishing oppressors
does not count as sins'

2485
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,250
'Set off like a storm'

2486
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:47,750
'Set off like a storm'

2487
02:38:48,750 --> 02:38:51,125
'When your wings are torn apart,
stand not with patience'

2488
02:38:51,250 --> 02:38:53,541
'If you rise with fury,
the oppression cannot go on'

2489
02:38:53,666 --> 02:38:55,125
'Be the action'

2490
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,500
'Be the action'

2491
02:38:58,416 --> 02:39:00,750
'If there's evil afoot...'

2492
02:39:00,875 --> 02:39:03,000
'...mustn't it be quelled?'

2493
02:39:03,125 --> 02:39:07,375
'Cowards, we shall never be'

2494
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,625
'A day has a dawn and a dusk'

2495
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:15,541
'Waging war is the way to victory'

2496
02:39:15,666 --> 02:39:17,458
'Let's get this done,
one way or the other'
